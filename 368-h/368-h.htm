    <h2>
      AN APPRECIATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      THOUGH Russell H. Conwell&rsquo;s Acres of Diamonds have been spread all over
      the United States, time and care have made them more valuable, and now
      that they have been reset in black and white by their discoverer, they are
      to be laid in the hands of a multitude for their enrichment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same case with these gems there is a fascinating story of the
      Master Jeweler&rsquo;s life-work which splendidly illustrates the ultimate unit
      of power by showing what one man can do in one day and what one life is
      worth to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his neighbor and intimate friend in Philadelphia for thirty years, I am
      free to say that Russell H. Conwell&rsquo;s tall, manly figure stands out in the
      state of Pennsylvania as its first citizen and &ldquo;The Big Brother&rdquo; of its
      seven millions of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the beginning of his career he has been a credible witness in the
      Court of Public Works to the truth of the strong language of the New
      Testament Parable where it says, &ldquo;If ye have faith as a grain of
      mustard-seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, &lsquo;Remove hence to yonder
      place,&rsquo; AND IT SHALL REMOVE AND NOTHING SHALL BE IMPOSSIBLE UNTO YOU.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a student, schoolmaster, lawyer, preacher, organizer, thinker and
      writer, lecturer, educator, diplomat, and leader of men, he has made his
      mark on his city and state and the times in which he has lived. A man
      dies, but his good work lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      His ideas, ideals, and enthusiasms have inspired tens of thousands of
      lives. A book full of the energetics of a master workman is just what
      every young man cares for.

      <i>Friends</i>.&mdash;This lecture has been delivered under these
      circumstances: I visit a town or city, and try to arrive there early
      enough to see the postmaster, the barber, the keeper of the hotel, the
      principal of the schools, and the ministers of some of the churches, and
      then go into some of the factories and stores, and talk with the people,
      and get into sympathy with the local conditions of that town or city and
      see what has been their history, what opportunities they had, and what
      they had failed to do&mdash;and every town fails to do something&mdash;and
      then go to the lecture and talk to those people about the subjects which
      applied to their locality. &ldquo;Acres of Diamonds&rdquo;&mdash;the idea&mdash;has
      continuously been precisely the same. The idea is that in this country of
      ours every man has the opportunity to make more of himself than he does in
      his own environment, with his own skill, with his own energy, and with his
      own friends. RUSSELL H. CONWELL.

    <p>
      WHEN going down the Tigris and Euphrates rivers many years ago with a
      party of English travelers I found myself under the direction of an old
      Arab guide whom we hired up at Bagdad, and I have often thought how that
      guide resembled our barbers in certain mental characteristics. He thought
      that it was not only his duty to guide us down those rivers, and do what
      he was paid for doing, but also to entertain us with stories curious and
      weird, ancient and modern, strange and familiar. Many of them I have
      forgotten, and I am glad I have, but there is one I shall never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old guide was leading my camel by its halter along the banks of those
      ancient rivers, and he told me story after story until I grew weary of his
      story-telling and ceased to listen. I have never been irritated with that
      guide when he lost his temper as I ceased listening. But I remember that
      he took off his Turkish cap and swung it in a circle to get my attention.
      I could see it through the corner of my eye, but I determined not to look
      straight at him for fear he would tell another story. But although I am
      not a woman, I did finally look, and as soon as I did he went right into
      another story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said he, &ldquo;I will tell you a story now which I reserve for my particular
      friends.&rdquo; When he emphasized the words &ldquo;particular friends,&rdquo; I listened,
      and I have ever been glad I did. I really feel devoutly thankful, that
      there are 1,674 young men who have been carried through college by this
      lecture who are also glad that I did listen. The old guide told me that
      there once lived not far from the River Indus an ancient Persian by the
      name of Ali Hafed. He said that Ali Hafed owned a very large farm, that he
      had orchards, grain-fields, and gardens; that he had money at interest,
      and was a wealthy and contented man. He was contented because he was
      wealthy, and wealthy because he was contented. One day there visited that
      old Persian farmer one of these ancient Buddhist priests, one of the wise
      men of the East. He sat down by the fire and told the old farmer how this
      world of ours was made. He said that this world was once a mere bank of
      fog, and that the Almighty thrust His finger into this bank of fog, and
      began slowly to move His finger around, increasing the speed until at last
      He whirled this bank of fog into a solid ball of fire. Then it went
      rolling through the universe, burning its way through other banks of fog,
      and condensed the moisture without, until it fell in floods of rain upon
      its hot surface, and cooled the outward crust. Then the internal fires
      bursting outward through the crust threw up the mountains and hills, the
      valleys, the plains and prairies of this wonderful world of ours. If this
      internal molten mass came bursting out and cooled very quickly it became
      granite; less quickly copper, less quickly silver, less quickly gold, and,
      after gold, diamonds were made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the old priest, &ldquo;A diamond is a congealed drop of sunlight.&rdquo; Now that
      is literally scientifically true, that a diamond is an actual deposit of
      carbon from the sun. The old priest told Ali Hafed that if he had one
      diamond the size of his thumb he could purchase the county, and if he had
      a mine of diamonds he could place his children upon thrones through the
      influence of their great wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ali Hafed heard all about diamonds, how much they were worth, and went to
      his bed that night a poor man. He had not lost anything, but he was poor
      because he was discontented, and discontented because he feared he was
      poor. He said, &ldquo;I want a mine of diamonds,&rdquo; and he lay awake all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning he sought out the priest. I know by experience that a
      priest is very cross when awakened early in the morning, and when he shook
      that old priest out of his dreams, Ali Hafed said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me where I can find diamonds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diamonds! What do you want with diamonds?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, I wish to be immensely
      rich.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, then, go along and find them. That is all you have to do; go
      and find them, and then you have them.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know where to go.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Well, if you will find a river that runs through white sands, between
      high mountains, in those white sands you will always find diamonds.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t believe there is any such river.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes, there are plenty of them.
      All you have to do is to go and find them, and then you have them.&rdquo; Said
      Ali Hafed, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he sold his farm, collected his money, left his family in charge of a
      neighbor, and away he went in search of diamonds. He began his search,
      very properly to my mind, at the Mountains of the Moon. Afterward he came
      around into Palestine, then wandered on into Europe, and at last when his
      money was all spent and he was in rags, wretchedness, and poverty, he
      stood on the shore of that bay at Barcelona, in Spain, when a great tidal
      wave came rolling in between the pillars of Hercules, and the poor,
      afflicted, suffering, dying man could not resist the awful temptation to
      cast himself into that incoming tide, and he sank beneath its foaming
      crest, never to rise in this life again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that old guide had told me that awfully sad story he stopped the
      camel I was riding on and went back to fix the baggage that was coming off
      another camel, and I had an opportunity to muse over his story while he
      was gone. I remember saying to myself, &ldquo;Why did he reserve that story for
      his &lsquo;particular friends&rsquo;?&rdquo; There seemed to be no beginning, no middle, no
      end, nothing to it. That was the first story I had ever heard told in my
      life, and would be the first one I ever read, in which the hero was killed
      in the first chapter. I had but one chapter of that story, and the hero
      was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the guide came back and took up the halter of my camel, he went right
      ahead with the story, into the second chapter, just as though there had
      been no break. The man who purchased Ali Hafed&rsquo;s farm one day led his
      camel into the garden to drink, and as that camel put its nose into the
      shallow water of that garden brook, Ali Hafed&rsquo;s successor noticed a
      curious flash of light from the white sands of the stream. He pulled out a
      black stone having an eye of light reflecting all the hues of the rainbow.
      He took the pebble into the house and put it on the mantel which covers
      the central fires, and forgot all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later this same old priest came in to visit Ali Hafed&rsquo;s
      successor, and the moment he opened that drawing-room door he saw that
      flash of light on the mantel, and he rushed up to it, and shouted: &ldquo;Here
      is a diamond! Has Ali Hafed returned?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh no, Ali Hafed has not returned,
      and that is not a diamond. That is nothing but a stone we found right out
      here in our own garden.&rdquo; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;I tell you I know a
      diamond when I see it. I know positively that is a diamond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then together they rushed out into that old garden and stirred up the
      white sands with their fingers, and lo! there came up other more beautiful
      and valuable gems than the first. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said the guide to me, and,
      friends, it is historically true, &ldquo;was discovered the diamond-mine of
      Golconda, the most magnificent diamond-mine in all the history of mankind,
      excelling the Kimberly itself. The Kohinoor, and the Orloff of the crown
      jewels of England and Russia, the largest on earth, came from that mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When that old Arab guide told me the second chapter of his story, he then
      took off his Turkish cap and swung it around in the air again to get my
      attention to the moral. Those Arab guides have morals to their stories,
      although they are not always moral. As he swung his hat, he said to me,
      &ldquo;Had Ali Hafed remained at home and dug in his own cellar, or underneath
      his own wheat-fields, or in his own garden, instead of wretchedness,
      starvation, and death by suicide in a strange land, he would have had
      &lsquo;acres of diamonds.&rsquo; For every acre of that old farm, yes, every
      shovelful, afterward revealed gems which since have decorated the crowns
      of monarchs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had added the moral to his story I saw why he reserved it for &ldquo;his
      particular friends.&rdquo; But I did not tell him I could see it. It was that
      mean old Arab&rsquo;s way of going around a thing like a lawyer, to say
      indirectly what he did not dare say directly, that &ldquo;in his private opinion
      there was a certain young man then traveling down the Tigris River that
      might better be at home in America.&rdquo; I did not tell him I could see that,
      but I told him his story reminded me of one, and I told it to him quick,
      and I think I will tell it to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him of a man out in California in 1847 who owned a ranch. He heard
      they had discovered gold in southern California, and so with a passion for
      gold he sold his ranch to Colonel Sutter, and away he went, never to come
      back. Colonel Sutter put a mill upon a stream that ran through that ranch,
      and one day his little girl brought some wet sand from the raceway into
      their home and sifted it through her fingers before the fire, and in that
      falling sand a visitor saw the first shining scales of real gold that were
      ever discovered in California. The man who had owned that ranch wanted
      gold, and he could have secured it for the mere taking. Indeed,
      thirty-eight millions of dollars has been taken out of a very few acres
      since then. About eight years ago I delivered this lecture in a city that
      stands on that farm, and they told me that a one-third owner for years and
      years had been getting one hundred and twenty dollars in gold every
      fifteen minutes, sleeping or waking, without taxation. You and I would
      enjoy an income like that&mdash;if we didn&rsquo;t have to pay an income tax.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a better illustration really than that occurred here in our own
      Pennsylvania. If there is anything I enjoy above another on the platform,
      it is to get one of these German audiences in Pennsylvania before me, and
      fire that at them, and I enjoy it to-night. There was a man living in
      Pennsylvania, not unlike some Pennsylvanians you have seen, who owned a
      farm, and he did with that farm just what I should do with a farm if I
      owned one in Pennsylvania&mdash;he sold it. But before he sold it he
      decided to secure employment collecting coal-oil for his cousin, who was
      in the business in Canada, where they first discovered oil on this
      continent. They dipped it from the running streams at that early time. So
      this Pennsylvania farmer wrote to his cousin asking for employment. You
      see, friends, this farmer was not altogether a foolish man. No, he was
      not. He did not leave his farm until he had something else to do. <i>*Of
      all the simpletons the stars shine on I don&rsquo;t know of a worse one than the
      man who leaves one job before he has gotten another</i>. That has especial
      reference to my profession, and has no reference whatever to a man seeking
      a divorce. When he wrote to his cousin for employment, his cousin replied,
      &ldquo;I cannot engage you because you know nothing about the oil business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, then the old farmer said, &ldquo;I will know,&rdquo; and with most commendable
      zeal (characteristic of the students of Temple University) he set himself
      at the study of the whole subject. He began away back at the second day of
      God&rsquo;s creation when this world was covered thick and deep with that rich
      vegetation which since has turned to the primitive beds of coal. He
      studied the subject until he found that the drainings really of those rich
      beds of coal furnished the coal-oil that was worth pumping, and then he
      found how it came up with the living springs. He studied until he knew
      what it looked like, smelled like, tasted like, and how to refine it. Now
      said he in his letter to his cousin, &ldquo;I understand the oil business.&rdquo; His
      cousin answered, &ldquo;All right, come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he sold his farm, according to the county record, for $833 (even money,
      &ldquo;no cents&rdquo;). He had scarcely gone from that place before the man who
      purchased the spot went out to arrange for the watering of the cattle. He
      found the previous owner had gone out years before and put a plank across
      the brook back of the barn, edgewise into the surface of the water just a
      few inches. The purpose of that plank at that sharp angle across the brook
      was to throw over to the other bank a dreadful-looking scum through which
      the cattle would not put their noses. But with that plank there to throw
      it all over to one side, the cattle would drink below, and thus that man
      who had gone to Canada had been himself damming back for twenty-three
      years a flood of coal-oil which the state geologists of Pennsylvania
      declared to us ten years later was even then worth a hundred millions of
      dollars to our state, and four years ago our geologist declared the
      discovery to be worth to our state a thousand millions of dollars. The man
      who owned that territory on which the city of Titusville now stands, and
      those Pleasantville valleys, had studied the subject from the second day
      of God&rsquo;s creation clear down to the present time. He studied it until he
      knew all about it, and yet he is said to have sold the whole of it for
      $833, and again I say, &ldquo;no sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I need another illustration. I found it in Massachusetts, and I am
      sorry I did because that is the state I came from. This young man in
      Massachusetts furnishes just another phase of my thought. He went to Yale
      College and studied mines and mining, and became such an adept as a mining
      engineer that he was employed by the authorities of the university to
      train students who were behind their classes. During his senior year he
      earned $15 a week for doing that work. When he graduated they raised his
      pay from $15 to $45 a week, and offered him a professorship, and as soon
      as they did he went right home to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>*If they had raised that boy&rsquo;s pay from $15 to $15.60 he would have
      stayed and been proud of the place, but when they put it up to $45 at one
      leap, he said, &ldquo;Mother, I won&rsquo;t work for $45 a week. The idea of a man
      with a brain like mine working for $45 a week!</i> Let&rsquo;s go out in
      California and stake out gold-mines and silver-mines, and be immensely
      rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Said his mother, &ldquo;Now, Charlie, it is just as well to be happy as it is to
      be rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Charlie, &ldquo;but it is just as well to be rich and happy, too.&rdquo;
       And they were both right about it. As he was an only son and she a widow,
      of course he had his way. They always do.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sold out in Massachusetts, and instead of going to California they
      went to Wisconsin, where he went into the employ of the Superior Copper
      Mining Company at $15 a week again, but with the proviso in his contract
      that he should have an interest in any mines he should discover for the
      company. I don&rsquo;t believe he ever discovered a mine, and if I am looking in
      the face of any stockholder of that copper company you wish he had
      discovered something or other. I have friends who are not here because
      they could not afford a ticket, who did have stock in that company at the
      time this young man was employed there. This young man went out there, and
      I have not heard a word from him. I don&rsquo;t know what became of him, and I
      don&rsquo;t know whether he found any mines or not, but I don&rsquo;t believe he ever
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I do know the other end of the line. He had scarcely gotten out of the
      old homestead before the succeeding owner went out to dig potatoes. The
      potatoes were already growing in the ground when he bought the farm, and
      as the old farmer was bringing in a basket of potatoes it hugged very
      tight between the ends of the stone fence. You know in Massachusetts our
      farms are nearly all stone wall. There you are obliged to be very
      economical of front gateways in order to have some place to put the stone.
      When that basket hugged so tight he set it down on the ground, and then
      dragged on one side, and pulled on the other side, and as he was dragging
      that basket through this farmer noticed in the upper and outer corner of
      that stone wall, right next the gate, a block of native silver eight
      inches square. That professor of mines, mining, and mineralogy who knew so
      much about the subject that he would not work for $45 a week, when he sold
      that homestead in Massachusetts sat right on that silver to make the
      bargain. He was born on that homestead, was brought up there, and had gone
      back and forth rubbing the stone with his sleeve until it reflected his
      countenance, and seemed to say, &ldquo;Here is a hundred thousand dollars right
      down here just for the taking.&rdquo; But he would not take it. It was in a home
      in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and there was no silver there, all away off&mdash;well,
      I don&rsquo;t know where, and he did not, but somewhere else, and he was a
      professor of mineralogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friends, that mistake is very universally made, and why should we even
      smile at him. I often wonder what has become of him. I do not know at all,
      but I will tell you what I &ldquo;guess&rdquo; as a Yankee. I guess that he sits out
      there by his fireside to-night with his friends gathered around him, and
      he is saying to them something like this: &ldquo;Do you know that man Conwell
      who lives in Philadelphia?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes, I have heard of him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you know
      that man Jones that lives in Philadelphia?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I have heard of him,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he begins to laugh, and shakes his sides and says to his friends,
      &ldquo;Well, they have done just the same thing I did, precisely&rdquo;&mdash;and that
      spoils the whole joke, for you and I have done the same thing he did, and
      while we sit here and laugh at him he has a better right to sit out there
      and laugh at us. I know I have made the same mistakes, but, of course,
      that does not make any difference, because we don&rsquo;t expect the same man to
      preach and practise, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I come here to-night and look around this audience I am seeing again
      what through these fifty years I have continually seen-men that are making
      precisely that same mistake. I often wish I could see the younger people,
      and would that the Academy had been filled to-night with our high-school
      scholars and our grammar-school scholars, that I could have them to talk
      to. While I would have preferred such an audience as that, because they
      are most susceptible, as they have not grown up into their prejudices as
      we have, they have not gotten into any custom that they cannot break, they
      have not met with any failures as we have; and while I could perhaps do
      such an audience as that more good than I can do grown-up people, yet I
      will do the best I can with the material I have. I say to you that you
      have &ldquo;acres of diamonds&rdquo; in Philadelphia right where you now live. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
       but you will say, &ldquo;you cannot know much about your city if you think there
      are any &lsquo;acres of diamonds&rsquo; here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was greatly interested in that account in the newspaper of the young man
      who found that diamond in North Carolina. It was one of the purest
      diamonds that has ever been discovered, and it has several predecessors
      near the same locality. I went to a distinguished professor in mineralogy
      and asked him where he thought those diamonds came from. The professor
      secured the map of the geologic formations of our continent, and traced
      it. He said it went either through the underlying carboniferous strata
      adapted for such production, westward through Ohio and the Mississippi, or
      in more probability came eastward through Virginia and up the shore of the
      Atlantic Ocean. It is a fact that the diamonds were there, for they have
      been discovered and sold; and that they were carried down there during the
      drift period, from some northern locality. Now who can say but some person
      going down with his drill in Philadelphia will find some trace of a
      diamond-mine yet down here? Oh, friends! you cannot say that you are not
      over one of the greatest diamond-mines in the world, for such a diamond as
      that only comes from the most profitable mines that are found on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it serves simply to illustrate my thought, which I emphasize by saying
      if you do not have the actual diamond-mines literally you have all that
      they would be good for to you. Because now that the Queen of England has
      given the greatest compliment ever conferred upon American woman for her
      attire because she did not appear with any jewels at all at the late
      reception in England, it has almost done away with the use of diamonds
      anyhow. All you would care for would be the few you would wear if you wish
      to be modest, and the rest you would sell for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now then, I say again that the opportunity to get rich, to attain unto
      great wealth, is here in Philadelphia now, within the reach of almost
      every man and woman who hears me speak to-night, and I mean just what I
      say. I have not come to this platform even under these circumstances to
      recite something to you. I have come to tell you what in God&rsquo;s sight I
      believe to be the truth, and if the years of life have been of any value
      to me in the attainment of common sense, I know I am right; that the men
      and women sitting here, who found it difficult perhaps to buy a ticket to
      this lecture or gathering to-night, have within their reach &ldquo;acres of
      diamonds,&rdquo; opportunities to get largely wealthy. There never was a place
      on earth more adapted than the city of Philadelphia to-day, and never in
      the history of the world did a poor man without capital have such an
      opportunity to get rich quickly and honestly as he has now in our city. I
      say it is the truth, and I want you to accept it as such; for if you think
      I have come to simply recite something, then I would better not be here. I
      have no time to waste in any such talk, but to say the things I believe,
      and unless some of you get richer for what I am saying to-night my time is
      wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say that you ought to get rich, and it is your duty to get rich. How
      many of my pious brethren say to me, &ldquo;Do you, a Christian minister, spend
      your time going up and down the country advising young people to get rich,
      to get money?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, of course I do.&rdquo; They say, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that awful! Why
      don&rsquo;t you preach the gospel instead of preaching about man&rsquo;s making
      money?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because to make money honestly is to preach the gospel.&rdquo; That is
      the reason. The men who get rich may be the most honest men you find in
      the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; but says some young man here to-night, &ldquo;I have been told all my life
      that if a person has money he is very dishonest and dishonorable and mean
      and contemptible.&rdquo; My friend, that is the reason why you have none,
      because you have that idea of people. The foundation of your faith is
      altogether false. Let me say here clearly, and say it briefly, though
      subject to discussion which I have not time for here, ninety-eight out of
      one hundred of the rich men of America are honest. That is why they are
      rich. That is why they are trusted with money. That is why they carry on
      great enterprises and find plenty of people to work with them. It is
      because they are honest men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Says another young man, &ldquo;I hear sometimes of men that get millions of
      dollars dishonestly.&rdquo; Yes, of course you do, and so do I. But they are so
      rare a thing in fact that the newspapers talk about them all the time as a
      matter of news until you get the idea that all the other rich men got rich
      dishonestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend, you take and drive me&mdash;if you furnish the auto&mdash;out
      into the suburbs of Philadelphia, and introduce me to the people who own
      their homes around this great city, those beautiful homes with gardens and
      flowers, those magnificent homes so lovely in their art, and I will
      introduce you to the very best people in character as well as in
      enterprise in our city, and you know I will. A man is not really a true
      man until he owns his own home, and they that own their homes are made
      more honorable and honest and pure, and true and economical and careful,
      by owning the home.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a man to have money, even in large sums, is not an inconsistent thing.
      We preach against covetousness, and you know we do, in the pulpit, and
      oftentimes preach against it so long and use the terms about &ldquo;filthy
      lucre&rdquo; so extremely that Christians get the idea that when we stand in the
      pulpit we believe it is wicked for any man to have money&mdash;until the
      collection-basket goes around, and then we almost swear at the people
      because they don&rsquo;t give more money. Oh, the inconsistency of such
      doctrines as that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Money is power, and you ought to be reasonably ambitious to have it. You
      ought because you can do more good with it than you could without it.
      Money printed your Bible, money builds your churches, money sends your
      missionaries, and money pays your preachers, and you would not have many
      of them, either, if you did not pay them. I am always willing that my
      church should raise my salary, because the church that pays the largest
      salary always raises it the easiest. You never knew an exception to it in
      your life. The man who gets the largest salary can do the most good with
      the power that is furnished to him. Of course he can if his spirit be
      right to use it for what it is given to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say, then, you ought to have money. If you can honestly attain unto
      riches in Philadelphia, it is your Christian and godly duty to do so. It
      is an awful mistake of these pious people to think you must be awfully
      poor in order to be pious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some men say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you sympathize with the poor people?&rdquo; Of course I do,
      or else I would not have been lecturing these years. I won&rsquo;t give in but
      what I sympathize with the poor, but the number of poor who are to be
      sympathized with is very small. To sympathize with a man whom God has
      punished for his sins, thus to help him when God would still continue a
      just punishment, is to do wrong, no doubt about it, and we do that more
      than we help those who are deserving. While we should sympathize with
      God&rsquo;s poor&mdash;that is, those who cannot help themselves&mdash;let us
      remember there is not a poor person in the United States who was not made
      poor by his own shortcomings, or by the shortcomings of some one else. It
      is all wrong to be poor, anyhow. Let us give in to that argument and pass
      that to one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentleman gets up back there, and says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think there are some
      things in this world that are better than money?&rdquo; Of course I do, but I am
      talking about money now. Of course there are some things higher than
      money. Oh yes, I know by the grave that has left me standing alone that
      there are some things in this world that are higher and sweeter and purer
      than money. Well do I know there are some things higher and grander than
      gold. Love is the grandest thing on God&rsquo;s earth, but fortunate the lover
      who has plenty of money. Money is power, money is force, money will do
      good as well as harm. In the hands of good men and women it could
      accomplish, and it has accomplished, good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate to leave that behind me. I heard a man get up in a prayer-meeting
      in our city and thank the Lord he was &ldquo;one of God&rsquo;s poor.&rdquo; Well, I wonder
      what his wife thinks about that? She earns all the money that comes into
      that house, and he smokes a part of that on the veranda. I don&rsquo;t want to
      see any more of the Lord&rsquo;s poor of that kind, and I don&rsquo;t believe the Lord
      does. And yet there are some people who think in order to be pious you
      must be awfully poor and awfully dirty. That does not follow at all. While
      we sympathize with the poor, let us not teach a doctrine like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the age is prejudiced against advising a Christian man (or, as a Jew
      would say, a godly man) from attaining unto wealth. The prejudice is so
      universal and the years are far enough back, I think, for me to safely
      mention that years ago up at Temple University there was a young man in
      our theological school who thought he was the only pious student in that
      department. He came into my office one evening and sat down by my desk,
      and said to me: &ldquo;Mr. President, I think it is my duty sir, to come in and
      labor with you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What has happened now?&rdquo; Said he, &ldquo;I heard you say at the
      Academy, at the Peirce School commencement, that you thought it was an
      honorable ambition for a young man to desire to have wealth, and that you
      thought it made him temperate, made him anxious to have a good name, and
      made him industrious. You spoke about man&rsquo;s ambition to have money helping
      to make him a good man. Sir, I have come to tell you the Holy Bible says
      that &lsquo;money is the root of all evil.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him I had never seen it in the Bible, and advised him to go out
      into the chapel and get the Bible, and show me the place. So out he went
      for the Bible, and soon he stalked into my office with the Bible open,
      with all the bigoted pride of the narrow sectarian, or of one who founds
      his Christianity on some misinterpretation of Scripture. He flung the
      Bible down on my desk, and fairly squealed into my ear: &ldquo;There it is, Mr.
      President; you can read it for yourself.&rdquo; I said to him: &ldquo;Well, young man,
      you will learn when you get a little older that you cannot trust another
      denomination to read the Bible for you. You belong to another
      denomination. You are taught in the theological school, however, that
      emphasis is exegesis. Now, will you take that Bible and read it yourself,
      and give the proper emphasis to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the Bible, and proudly read, &ldquo;&lsquo;The love of money is the root of
      all evil.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he had it right, and when one does quote aright from that same old
      Book he quotes the absolute truth. I have lived through fifty years of the
      mightiest battle that old Book has ever fought, and I have lived to see
      its banners flying free; for never in the history of this world did the
      great minds of earth so universally agree that the Bible is true&mdash;all
      true&mdash;as they do at this very hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I say that when he quoted right, of course he quoted the absolute
      truth. &ldquo;The love of money is the root of all evil.&rdquo; He who tries to attain
      unto it too quickly, or dishonestly, will fall into many snares, no doubt
      about that. The love of money. What is that? It is making an idol of
      money, and idolatry pure and simple everywhere is condemned by the Holy
      Scriptures and by man&rsquo;s common sense. The man that worships the dollar
      instead of thinking of the purposes for which it ought to be used, the man
      who idolizes simply money, the miser that hordes his money in the cellar,
      or hides it in his stocking, or refuses to invest it where it will do the
      world good, that man who hugs the dollar until the eagle squeals has in
      him the root of all evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I will leave that behind me now and answer the question of nearly
      all of you who are asking, &ldquo;Is there opportunity to get rich in
      Philadelphia?&rdquo; Well, now, how simple a thing it is to see where it is, and
      the instant you see where it is it is yours. Some old gentleman gets up
      back there and says, &ldquo;Mr. Conwell, have you lived in Philadelphia for
      thirty-one years and don&rsquo;t know that the time has gone by when you can
      make anything in this city?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it is.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it is; I
      have tried it.&rdquo; &ldquo;What business are you in?&rdquo; &ldquo;I kept a store here for
      twenty years, and never made over a thousand dollars in the whole twenty
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you can measure the good you have been to this city by what
      this city has paid you, because a man can judge very well what he is worth
      by what he receives; that is, in what he is to the world at this time. If
      you have not made over a thousand dollars in twenty years in Philadelphia,
      it would have been better for Philadelphia if they had kicked you out of
      the city nineteen years and nine months ago. A man has no right to keep a
      store in Philadelphia twenty years and not make at least five hundred
      thousand dollars even though it be a corner grocery up-town.&rdquo; You say,
      &ldquo;You cannot make five thousand dollars in a store now.&rdquo; Oh, my friends, if
      you will just take only four blocks around you, and find out what the
      people want and what you ought to supply and set them down with your
      pencil and figure up the profits you would make if you did supply them,
      you would very soon see it. There is wealth right within the sound of your
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one says: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything about business. A preacher never
      knows a thing about business.&rdquo; Well, then, I will have to prove that I am
      an expert. I don&rsquo;t like to do this, but I have to do it because my
      testimony will not be taken if I am not an expert. My father kept a
      country store, and if there is any place under the stars where a man gets
      all sorts of experience in every kind of mercantile transactions, it is in
      the country store. I am not proud of my experience, but sometimes when my
      father was away he would leave me in charge of the store, though
      fortunately for him that was not very often. But this did occur many
      times, friends: A man would come in the store, and say to me, &ldquo;Do you keep
      jack knives?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t keep jack-knives,&rdquo; and I went off whistling a
      tune. What did I care about that man, anyhow? Then another farmer would
      come in and say, &ldquo;Do you keep jack knives?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t keep
      jack-knives.&rdquo; Then I went away and whistled another tune. Then a third man
      came right in the same door and said, &ldquo;Do you keep jack-knives?&rdquo; &ldquo;No. Why
      is every one around here asking for jack-knives? Do you suppose we are
      keeping this store to supply the whole neighborhood with jack-knives?&rdquo; Do
      you carry on your store like that in Philadelphia? The difficulty was I
      had not then learned that the foundation of godliness and the foundation
      principle of success in business are both the same precisely. The man who
      says, &ldquo;I cannot carry my religion into business&rdquo; advertises himself either
      as being an imbecile in business, or on the road to bankruptcy, or a
      thief, one of the three, sure. He will fail within a very few years. He
      certainly will if he doesn&rsquo;t carry his religion into business. If I had
      been carrying on my father&rsquo;s store on a Christian plan, godly plan, I
      would have had a jack-knife for the third man when he called for it. Then
      I would have actually done him a kindness, and I would have received a
      reward myself, which it would have been my duty to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some over-pious Christian people who think if you take any
      profit on anything you sell that you are an unrighteous man. On the
      contrary, you would be a criminal to sell goods for less than they cost.
      You have no right to do that. You cannot trust a man with your money who
      cannot take care of his own. You cannot trust a man in your family that is
      not true to his own wife. You cannot trust a man in the world that does
      not begin with his own heart, his own character, and his own life. It
      would have been my duty to have furnished a jack-knife to the third man,
      or the second, and to have sold it to him and actually profited myself. I
      have no more right to sell goods without making a profit on them than I
      have to overcharge him dishonestly beyond what they are worth. But I
      should so sell each bill of goods that the person to whom I sell shall
      make as much as I make.
    </p>
    <p>
      To live and let live is the principle of the gospel, and the principle of
      every-day common sense. Oh, young man, hear me; live as you go along. Do
      not wait until you have reached my years before you begin to enjoy
      anything of this life. If I had the millions back, or fifty cents of it,
      which I have tried to earn in these years, it would not do me anything
      like the good that it does me now in this almost sacred presence to-night.
      Oh, yes, I am paid over and over a hundredfold to-night for dividing as I
      have tried to do in some measure as I went along through the years. I
      ought not speak that way, it sounds egotistic, but I am old enough now to
      be excused for that. I should have helped my fellow-men, which I have
      tried to do, and every one should try to do, and get the happiness of it.
      The man who goes home with the sense that he has stolen a dollar that day,
      that he has robbed a man of what was his honest due, is not going to sweet
      rest. He arises tired in the morning, and goes with an unclean conscience
      to his work the next day. He is not a successful man at all, although he
      may have laid up millions. But the man who has gone through life dividing
      always with his fellow-men, making and demanding his own rights and his
      own profits, and giving to every other man his rights and profits, lives
      every day, and not only that, but it is the royal road to great wealth.
      The history of the thousands of millionaires shows that to be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man over there who said he could not make anything in a store in
      Philadelphia has been carrying on his store on the wrong principle.
      Suppose I go into your store to-morrow morning and ask, &ldquo;Do you know
      neighbor A, who lives one square away, at house No. 1240?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes, I have
      met him. He deals here at the corner store.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where did he come from?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; &ldquo;How many does he have in his family?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; &ldquo;What
      ticket does he vote?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; &ldquo;What church does he go to?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know, and don&rsquo;t care. What are you asking all these questions for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If you had a store in Philadelphia would you answer me like that? If so,
      then you are conducting your business just as I carried on my father&rsquo;s
      business in Worthington, Massachusetts. You don&rsquo;t know where your neighbor
      came from when he moved to Philadelphia, and you don&rsquo;t care. If you had
      cared you would be a rich man now. If you had cared enough about him to
      take an interest in his affairs, to find out what he needed, you would
      have been rich. But you go through the world saying, &ldquo;No opportunity to
      get rich,&rdquo; and there is the fault right at your own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But another young man gets up over there and says, &ldquo;I cannot take up the
      mercantile business.&rdquo; (While I am talking of trade it applies to every
      occupation.) &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you go into the mercantile business?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because I
      haven&rsquo;t any capital.&rdquo; Oh, the weak and dudish creature that can&rsquo;t see over
      its collar! It makes a person weak to see these little dudes standing
      around the corners and saying, &ldquo;Oh, if I had plenty of capital, how rich I
      would get.&rdquo; &ldquo;Young man, do you think you are going to get rich on
      capital?&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Well, I say, &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo; If your mother has
      plenty of money, and she will set you up in business, you will &ldquo;set her up
      in business,&rdquo; supplying you with capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment a young man or woman gets more money than he or she has grown
      to by practical experience, that moment he has gotten a curse. It is no
      help to a young man or woman to inherit money. It is no help to your
      children to leave them money, but if you leave them education, if you
      leave them Christian and noble character, if you leave them a wide circle
      of friends, if you leave them an honorable name, it is far better than
      that they should have money. It would be worse for them, worse for the
      nation, that they should have any money at all. Oh, young man, if you have
      inherited money, don&rsquo;t regard it as a help. It will curse you through your
      years, and deprive you of the very best things of human life. There is no
      class of people to be pitied so much as the inexperienced sons and
      daughters of the rich of our generation. I pity the rich man&rsquo;s son. He can
      never know the best things in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the best things in our life is when a young man has earned his own
      living, and when he becomes engaged to some lovely young woman, and makes
      up his mind to have a home of his own. Then with that same love comes also
      that divine inspiration toward better things, and he begins to save his
      money. He begins to leave off his bad habits and put money in the bank.
      When he has a few hundred dollars he goes out in the suburbs to look for a
      home. He goes to the savings-bank, perhaps, for half of the value, and
      then goes for his wife, and when he takes his bride over the threshold of
      that door for the first time he says in words of eloquence my voice can
      never touch: &ldquo;I have earned this home myself. It is all mine, and I divide
      with thee.&rdquo; That is the grandest moment a human heart may ever know.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a rich man&rsquo;s son can never know that. He takes his bride into a finer
      mansion, it may be, but he is obliged to go all the way through it and say
      to his wife, &ldquo;My mother gave me that, my mother gave me that, and my
      mother gave me this,&rdquo; until his wife wishes she had married his mother. I
      pity the rich man&rsquo;s son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statistics of Massachusetts showed that not one rich man&rsquo;s son out of
      seventeen ever dies rich. I pity the rich man&rsquo;s sons unless they have the
      good sense of the elder Vanderbilt, which sometimes happens. He went to
      his father and said, &ldquo;Did you earn all your money?&rdquo; &ldquo;I did, my son. I
      began to work on a ferry-boat for twenty-five cents a day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said
      his son, &ldquo;I will have none of your money,&rdquo; and he, too, tried to get
      employment on a ferry-boat that Saturday night. He could not get one
      there, but he did get a place for three dollars a week. Of course, if a
      rich man&rsquo;s son will do that, he will get the discipline of a poor boy that
      is worth more than a university education to any man. He would then be
      able to take care of the millions of his father. But as a rule the rich
      men will not let their sons do the very thing that made them great. As a
      rule, the rich man will not allow his son to work&mdash;and his mother!
      Why, she would think it was a social disgrace if her poor, weak, little
      lily-fingered, sissy sort of a boy had to earn his living with honest
      toil. I have no pity for such rich men&rsquo;s sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember one at Niagara Falls. I think I remember one a great deal
      nearer. I think there are gentlemen present who were at a great banquet,
      and I beg pardon of his friends. At a banquet here in Philadelphia there
      sat beside me a kind-hearted young man, and he said, &ldquo;Mr. Conwell, you
      have been sick for two or three years. When you go out, take my limousine,
      and it will take you up to your house on Broad Street.&rdquo; I thanked him very
      much, and perhaps I ought not to mention the incident in this way, but I
      follow the facts. I got on to the seat with the driver of that limousine,
      outside, and when we were going up I asked the driver, &ldquo;How much did this
      limousine cost?&rdquo; &ldquo;Six thousand eight hundred, and he had to pay the duty
      on it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;does the owner of this machine ever drive it
      himself?&rdquo; At that the chauffeur laughed so heartily that he lost control
      of his machine. He was so surprised at the question that he ran up on the
      sidewalk, and around a corner lamp-post out into the street again. And
      when he got out into the street he laughed till the whole machine
      trembled. He said: &ldquo;He drive this machine! Oh, he would be lucky if he
      knew enough to get out when we get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I must tell you about a rich man&rsquo;s son at Niagara Falls. I came in from
      the lecture to the hotel, and as I approached the desk of the clerk there
      stood a millionaire&rsquo;s son from New York. He was an indescribable specimen
      of anthropologic potency. He had a skull-cap on one side of his head, with
      a gold tassel in the top of it, and a gold-headed cane under his arm with
      more in it than in his head. It is a very difficult thing to describe that
      young man. He wore an eye-glass that he could not see through,
      patent-leather boots that he could not walk in, and pants that he could
      not sit down in&mdash;dressed like a grasshopper. This human cricket came
      up to the clerk&rsquo;s desk just as I entered, adjusted his unseeing eye-glass,
      and spake in this wise to the clerk. You see, he thought it was &ldquo;Hinglish,
      you know,&rdquo; to lisp. &ldquo;Thir, will you have the kindness to supply me with
      thome papah and enwelophs!&rdquo; The hotel clerk measured that man quick, and
      he pulled the envelopes and paper out of a drawer, threw them across the
      counter toward the young man, and then turned away to his books. You
      should have seen that young man when those envelopes came across that
      counter. He swelled up like a gobbler turkey, adjusted his unseeing
      eye-glass, and yelled: &ldquo;Come right back here. Now thir, will you order a
      thervant to take that papah and enwelophs to yondah dethk.&rdquo; Oh, the poor,
      miserable, contemptible American monkey! He could not carry paper and
      envelopes twenty feet. I suppose he could not get his arms down to do it.
      I have no pity for such travesties upon human nature. If you have not
      capital, young man, I am glad of it. What you need is common sense, not
      copper cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best thing I can do is to illustrate by actual facts well-known to you
      all. A. T. Stewart, a poor boy in New York, had $1.50 to begin life on. He
      lost 87 1/2 cents of that on the very first venture. How fortunate that
      young man who loses the first time he gambles. That boy said, &ldquo;I will
      never gamble again in business,&rdquo; and he never did. How came he to lose 87
      1/2 cents? You probably all know the story how he lost it&mdash;because he
      bought some needles, threads, and buttons to sell which people did not
      want, and had them left on his hands, a dead loss. Said the boy, &ldquo;I will
      not lose any more money in that way.&rdquo; Then he went around first to the
      doors and asked the people what they did want. Then when he had found out
      what they wanted he invested his 62 1/2 cents to supply a known demand.
      Study it wherever you choose&mdash;in business, in your profession, in
      your housekeeping, whatever your life, that one thing is the secret of
      success. You must first know the demand. You must first know what people
      need, and then invest yourself where you are most needed. A. T. Stewart
      went on that principle until he was worth what amounted afterward to forty
      millions of dollars, owning the very store in which Mr. Wanamaker carries
      on his great work in New York. His fortune was made by his losing
      something, which taught him the great lesson that he must only invest
      himself or his money in something that people need. When will you salesmen
      learn it? When will you manufacturers learn that you must know the
      changing needs of humanity if you would succeed in life? Apply yourselves,
      all you Christian people, as manufacturers or merchants or workmen to
      supply that human need. It is a great principle as broad as humanity and
      as deep as the Scripture itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best illustration I ever heard was of John Jacob Astor. You know that
      he made the money of the Astor family when he lived in New York. He came
      across the sea in debt for his fare. But that poor boy with nothing in his
      pocket made the fortune of the Astor family on one principle. Some young
      man here to-night will say, &ldquo;Well they could make those fortunes over in
      New York but they could not do it in Philadelphia!&rdquo; My friends, did you
      ever read that wonderful book of Riis (his memory is sweet to us because
      of his recent death), wherein is given his statistical account of the
      records taken in 1889 of 107 millionaires of New York. If you read the
      account you will see that out of the 107 millionaires only seven made
      their money in New York. Out of the 107 millionaires worth ten million
      dollars in real estate then, 67 of them made their money in towns of less
      than 3,500 inhabitants. The richest man in this country to-day, if you
      read the real-estate values, has never moved away from a town of 3,500
      inhabitants. It makes not so much difference where you are as who you are.
      But if you cannot get rich in Philadelphia you certainly cannot do it in
      New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now John Jacob Astor illustrated what can be done anywhere. He had a
      mortgage once on a millinery-store, and they could not sell bonnets enough
      to pay the interest on his money. So he foreclosed that mortgage, took
      possession of the store, and went into partnership with the very same
      people, in the same store, with the same capital. He did not give them a
      dollar of capital. They had to sell goods to get any money. Then he left
      them alone in the store just as they had been before, and he went out and
      sat down on a bench in the park in the shade. What was John Jacob Astor
      doing out there, and in partnership with people who had failed on his own
      hands? He had the most important and, to my mind, the most pleasant part
      of that partnership on his hands. For as John Jacob Astor sat on that
      bench he was watching the ladies as they went by; and where is the man who
      would not get rich at that business? As he sat on the bench if a lady
      passed him with her shoulders back and head up, and looked straight to the
      front, as if she did not care if all the world did gaze on her, then he
      studied her bonnet, and by the time it was out of sight he knew the shape
      of the frame, the color of the trimmings, and the crinklings in the
      feather. I sometimes try to describe a bonnet, but not always. I would not
      try to describe a modern bonnet. Where is the man that could describe one?
      This aggregation of all sorts of driftwood stuck on the back of the head,
      or the side of the neck, like a rooster with only one tail feather left.
      But in John Jacob Astor&rsquo;s day there was some art about the millinery
      business, and he went to the millinery-store and said to them: &ldquo;Now put
      into the show-window just such a bonnet as I describe to you, because I
      have already seen a lady who likes such a bonnet. Don&rsquo;t make up any more
      until I come back.&rdquo; Then he went out and sat down again, and another lady
      passed him of a different form, of different complexion, with a different
      shape and color of bonnet. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;put such a bonnet as that in
      the show window.&rdquo; He did not fill his show-window up town with a lot of
      hats and bonnets to drive people away, and then sit on the back stairs and
      bawl because people went to Wanamaker&rsquo;s to trade. He did not have a hat or
      a bonnet in that show-window but what some lady liked before it was made
      up. The tide of custom began immediately to turn in, and that has been the
      foundation of the greatest store in New York in that line, and still
      exists as one of three stores. Its fortune was made by John Jacob Astor
      after they had failed in business, not by giving them any more money, but
      by finding out what the ladies liked for bonnets before they wasted any
      material in making them up. I tell you if a man could foresee the
      millinery business he could foresee anything under heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose I were to go through this audience to-night and ask you in this
      great manufacturing city if there are not opportunities to get rich in
      manufacturing. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; some young man says, &ldquo;there are opportunities
      here still if you build with some trust and if you have two or three
      millions of dollars to begin with as capital.&rdquo; Young man, the history of
      the breaking up of the trusts by that attack upon &ldquo;big business&rdquo; is only
      illustrating what is now the opportunity of the smaller man. The time
      never came in the history of the world when you could get rich so quickly
      manufacturing without capital as you can now.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you will say, &ldquo;You cannot do anything of the kind. You cannot start
      without capital.&rdquo; Young man, let me illustrate for a moment. I must do it.
      It is my duty to every young man and woman, because we are all going into
      business very soon on the same plan. Young man, remember if you know what
      people need you have gotten more knowledge of a fortune than any amount of
      capital can give you.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a poor man out of work living in Hingham, Massachusetts. He
      lounged around the house until one day his wife told him to get out and
      work, and, as he lived in Massachusetts, he obeyed his wife. He went out
      and sat down on the shore of the bay, and whittled a soaked shingle into a
      wooden chain. His children that evening quarreled over it, and he whittled
      a second one to keep peace. While he was whittling the second one a
      neighbor came in and said: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you whittle toys and sell them? You
      could make money at that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would not know what to make.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask your own children right here in your own house what to
      make?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is the use of trying that?&rdquo; said the carpenter. &ldquo;My children
      are different from other people&rsquo;s children.&rdquo; (I used to see people like
      that when I taught school.) But he acted upon the hint, and the next
      morning when Mary came down the stairway, he asked, &ldquo;What do you want for
      a toy?&rdquo; She began to tell him she would like a doll&rsquo;s bed, a doll&rsquo;s
      washstand, a doll&rsquo;s carriage, a little doll&rsquo;s umbrella, and went on with a
      list of things that would take him a lifetime to supply. So, consulting
      his own children, in his own house, he took the firewood, for he had no
      money to buy lumber, and whittled those strong, unpainted Hingham toys
      that were for so many years known all over the world. That man began to
      make those toys for his own children, and then made copies and sold them
      through the boot-and-shoe store next door. He began to make a little
      money, and then a little more, and Mr. Lawson, in his <i>Frenzied Finance</i>
      says that man is the richest man in old Massachusetts, and I think it is
      the truth. And that man is worth a hundred millions of dollars to-day, and
      has been only thirty-four years making it on that one principle&mdash;that
      one must judge that what his own children like at home other people&rsquo;s
      children would like in their homes, too; to judge the human heart by
      oneself, by one&rsquo;s wife or by one&rsquo;s children. It is the royal road to
      success in manufacturing. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; but you say, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t he have any capital?&rdquo;
       Yes, a penknife, but I don&rsquo;t know that he had paid for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke thus to an audience in New Britain, Connecticut, and a lady four
      seats back went home and tried to take off her collar, and the
      collar-button stuck in the buttonhole. She threw it out and said, &ldquo;I am
      going to get up something better than that to put on collars.&rdquo; Her husband
      said: &ldquo;After what Conwell said to-night, you see there is a need of an
      improved collar-fastener that is easier to handle. There is a human need;
      there is a great fortune. Now, then, get up a collar-button and get rich.&rdquo;
       He made fun of her, and consequently made fun of me, and that is one of
      the saddest things which comes over me like a deep cloud of midnight
      sometimes&mdash;although I have worked so hard for more than half a
      century, yet how little I have ever really done. Notwithstanding the
      greatness and the handsomeness of your compliment to-night, I do not
      believe there is one in ten of you that is going to make a million of
      dollars because you are here to-night; but it is not my fault, it is
      yours. I say that sincerely. What is the use of my talking if people never
      do what I advise them to do? When her husband ridiculed her, she made up
      her mind she would make a better collar-button, and when a woman makes up
      her mind &ldquo;she will,&rdquo; and does not say anything about it, she does it. It
      was that New England woman who invented the snap button which you can find
      anywhere now. It was first a collar-button with a spring cap attached to
      the outer side. Any of you who wear modern waterproofs know the button
      that simply pushes together, and when you unbutton it you simply pull it
      apart. That is the button to which I refer, and which she invented. She
      afterward invented several other buttons, and then invested in more, and
      then was taken into partnership with great factories. Now that woman goes
      over the sea every summer in her private steamship&mdash;yes, and takes
      her husband with her! If her husband were to die, she would have money
      enough left now to buy a foreign duke or count or some such title as that
      at the latest quotations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what is my lesson in that incident? It is this: I told her then,
      though I did not know her, what I now say to you, &ldquo;Your wealth is too near
      to you. You are looking right over it&rdquo;; and she had to look over it
      because it was right under her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have read in the newspaper that a woman never invented anything. Well,
      that newspaper ought to begin again. Of course, I do not refer to gossip&mdash;I
      refer to machines&mdash;and if I did I might better include the men. That
      newspaper could never appear if women had not invented something. Friends,
      think. Ye women, think! You say you cannot make a fortune because you are
      in some laundry, or running a sewing-machine, it may be, or walking before
      some loom, and yet you can be a millionaire if you will but follow this
      almost infallible direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you say a woman doesn&rsquo;t invent anything, I ask, Who invented the
      Jacquard loom that wove every stitch you wear? Mrs. Jacquard. The
      printer&rsquo;s roller, the printing-press, were invented by farmers&rsquo; wives. Who
      invented the cotton-gin of the South that enriched our country so
      amazingly? Mrs. General Greene invented the cotton-gin and showed the idea
      to Mr. Whitney, and he, like a man, seized it. Who was it that invented
      the sewing-machine? If I would go to school to-morrow and ask your
      children they would say, &ldquo;Elias Howe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in the Civil War with me, and often in my tent, and I often heard
      him say that he worked fourteen years to get up that sewing-machine. But
      his wife made up her mind one day that they would starve to death if there
      wasn&rsquo;t something or other invented pretty soon, and so in two hours she
      invented the sewing-machine. Of course he took out the patent in his name.
      Men always do that. Who was it that invented the mower and the reaper?
      According to Mr. McCormick&rsquo;s confidential communication, so recently
      published, it was a West Virginia woman, who, after his father and he had
      failed altogether in making a reaper and gave it up, took a lot of shears
      and nailed them together on the edge of a board, with one shaft of each
      pair loose, and then wired them so that when she pulled the wire one way
      it closed them, and when she pulled the wire the other way it opened them,
      and there she had the principle of the mowing-machine. If you look at a
      mowing-machine, you will see it is nothing but a lot of shears. If a woman
      can invent a mowing-machine, if a woman can invent a Jacquard loom, if a
      woman can invent a cotton-gin, if a woman can invent a trolley switch&mdash;as
      she did and made the trolleys possible; if a woman can invent, as Mr.
      Carnegie said, the great iron squeezers that laid the foundation of all
      the steel millions of the United States, &ldquo;we men&rdquo; can invent anything
      under the stars! I say that for the encouragement of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who are the great inventors of the world? Again this lesson comes before
      us. The great inventor sits next to you, or you are the person yourself.
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; but you will say, &ldquo;I have never invented anything in my life.&rdquo;
       Neither did the great inventors until they discovered one great secret. Do
      you think it is a man with a head like a bushel measure or a man like a
      stroke of lightning? It is neither. The really great man is a plain,
      straightforward, every-day, common-sense man. You would not dream that he
      was a great inventor if you did not see something he had actually done.
      His neighbors do not regard him so great. You never see anything great
      over your back fence. You say there is no greatness among your neighbors.
      It is all away off somewhere else. Their greatness is ever so simple, so
      plain, so earnest, so practical, that the neighbors and friends never
      recognize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      True greatness is often unrecognized. That is sure. You do not know
      anything about the greatest men and women. I went out to write the life of
      General Garfield, and a neighbor, knowing I was in a hurry, and as there
      was a great crowd around the front door, took me around to General
      Garfield&rsquo;s back door and shouted, &ldquo;Jim! Jim!&rdquo; And very soon &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; came to
      the door and let me in, and I wrote the biography of one of the grandest
      men of the nation, and yet he was just the same old &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; to his neighbor.
      If you know a great man in Philadelphia and you should meet him to-morrow,
      you would say, &ldquo;How are you, Sam?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good morning, Jim.&rdquo; Of course you
      would. That is just what you would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my soldiers in the Civil War had been sentenced to death, and I
      went up to the White House in Washington&mdash;sent there for the first
      time in my life to see the President. I went into the waiting-room and sat
      down with a lot of others on the benches, and the secretary asked one
      after another to tell him what they wanted. After the secretary had been
      through the line, he went in, and then came back to the door and motioned
      for me. I went up to that anteroom, and the secretary said: &ldquo;That is the
      President&rsquo;s door right over there. Just rap on it and go right in.&rdquo; I
      never was so taken aback, friends, in all my life, never. The secretary
      himself made it worse for me, because he had told me how to go in and then
      went out another door to the left and shut that. There I was, in the
      hallway by myself before the President of the United States of America&rsquo;s
      door. I had been on fields of battle, where the shells did sometimes
      shriek and the bullets did sometimes hit me, but I always wanted to run. I
      have no sympathy with the old man who says, &ldquo;I would just as soon march up
      to the cannon&rsquo;s mouth as eat my dinner.&rdquo; I have no faith in a man who
      doesn&rsquo;t know enough to be afraid when he is being shot at. I never was so
      afraid when the shells came around us at Antietam as I was when I went
      into that room that day; but I finally mustered the courage&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know how I ever did&mdash;and at arm&rsquo;s-length tapped on the door. The man
      inside did not help me at all, but yelled out, &ldquo;Come in and sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, I went in and sat down on the edge of a chair, and wished I were in
      Europe, and the man at the table did not look up. He was one of the
      world&rsquo;s greatest men, and was made great by one single rule. Oh, that all
      the young people of Philadelphia were before me now and I could say just
      this one thing, and that they would remember it. I would give a lifetime
      for the effect it would have on our city and on civilization. Abraham
      Lincoln&rsquo;s principle for greatness can be adopted by nearly all. This was
      his rule: Whatsoever he had to do at all, he put his whole mind into it
      and held it all there until that was all done. That makes men great almost
      anywhere. He stuck to those papers at that table and did not look up at
      me, and I sat there trembling. Finally, when he had put the string around
      his papers, he pushed them over to one side and looked over to me, and a
      smile came over his worn face. He said: &ldquo;I am a very busy man and have
      only a few minutes to spare. Now tell me in the fewest words what it is
      you want.&rdquo; I began to tell him, and mentioned the case, and he said: &ldquo;I
      have heard all about it and you do not need to say any more. Mr. Stanton
      was talking to me only a few days ago about that. You can go to the hotel
      and rest assured that the President never did sign an order to shoot a boy
      under twenty years of age, and never will. You can say that to his mother
      anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he said to me, &ldquo;How is it going in the field?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;We sometimes
      get discouraged.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;It is all right. We are going to win out
      now. We are getting very near the light. No man ought to wish to be
      President of the United States, and I will be glad when I get through;
      then Tad and I are going out to Springfield, Illinois. I have bought a
      farm out there and I don&rsquo;t care if I again earn only twenty-five cents a
      day. Tad has a mule team, and we are going to plant onions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he asked me, &ldquo;Were you brought up on a farm?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes; in the
      Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.&rdquo; He then threw his leg over the corner
      of the big chair and said, &ldquo;I have heard many a time, ever since I was
      young, that up there in those hills you have to sharpen the noses of the
      sheep in order to get down to the grass between the rocks.&rdquo; He was so
      familiar, so everyday, so farmer-like, that I felt right at home with him
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then took hold of another roll of paper, and looked up at me and said,
      &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo; I took the hint then and got up and went out. After I had
      gotten out I could not realize I had seen the President of the United
      States at all. But a few days later, when still in the city, I saw the
      crowd pass through the East Room by the coffin of Abraham Lincoln, and
      when I looked at the upturned face of the murdered President I felt then
      that the man I had seen such a short time before, who, so simple a man, so
      plain a man, was one of the greatest men that God ever raised up to lead a
      nation on to ultimate liberty. Yet he was only &ldquo;Old Abe&rdquo; to his neighbors.
      When they had the second funeral, I was invited among others, and went out
      to see that same coffin put back in the tomb at Springfield. Around the
      tomb stood Lincoln&rsquo;s old neighbors, to whom he was just &ldquo;Old Abe.&rdquo; Of
      course that is all they would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you ever see a man who struts around altogether too large to notice an
      ordinary working mechanic? Do you think he is great? He is nothing but a
      puffed-up balloon, held down by his big feet. There is no greatness there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who are the great men and women? My attention was called the other day to
      the history of a very little thing that made the fortune of a very poor
      man. It was an awful thing, and yet because of that experience he&mdash;not
      a great inventor or genius&mdash;invented the pin that now is called the
      safety-pin, and out of that safety-pin made the fortune of one of the
      great aristocratic families of this nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A poor man in Massachusetts who had worked in the nail-works was injured
      at thirty-eight, and he could earn but little money. He was employed in
      the office to rub out the marks on the bills made by pencil memorandums,
      and he used a rubber until his hand grew tired. He then tied a piece of
      rubber on the end of a stick and worked it like a plane. His little girl
      came and said, &ldquo;Why, you have a patent, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The father said
      afterward, &ldquo;My daughter told me when I took that stick and put the rubber
      on the end that there was a patent, and that was the first thought of
      that.&rdquo; He went to Boston and applied for his patent, and every one of you
      that has a rubber-tipped pencil in your pocket is now paying tribute to
      the millionaire. No capital, not a penny did he invest in it. All was
      income, all the way up into the millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let me hasten to one other greater thought. &ldquo;Show me the great men and
      women who live in Philadelphia.&rdquo; A gentleman over there will get up and
      say: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any great men in Philadelphia. They don&rsquo;t live here.
      They live away off in Rome or St. Petersburg or London or Manayunk, or
      anywhere else but here in our town.&rdquo; I have come now to the apex of my
      thought. I have come now to the heart of the whole matter and to the
      center of my struggle: Why isn&rsquo;t Philadelphia a greater city in its
      greater wealth? Why does New York excel Philadelphia? People say, &ldquo;Because
      of her harbor.&rdquo; Why do many other cities of the United States get ahead of
      Philadelphia now? There is only one answer, and that is because our own
      people talk down their own city. If there ever was a community on earth
      that has to be forced ahead, it is the city of Philadelphia. If we are to
      have a boulevard, talk it down; if we are going to have better schools,
      talk them down; if you wish to have wise legislation, talk it down; talk
      all the proposed improvements down. That is the only great wrong that I
      can lay at the feet of the magnificent Philadelphia that has been so
      universally kind to me. I say it is time we turn around in our city and
      begin to talk up the things that are in our city, and begin to set them
      before the world as the people of Chicago, New York, St. Louis, and San
      Francisco do. Oh, if we only could get that spirit out among our people,
      that we can do things in Philadelphia and do them well!
    </p>
    <p>
      Arise, ye millions of Philadelphians, trust in God and man, and believe in
      the great opportunities that are right here not over in New York or
      Boston, but here&mdash;for business, for everything that is worth living
      for on earth. There was never an opportunity greater. Let us talk up our
      own city.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are two other young men here to-night, and that is all I will
      venture to say, because it is too late. One over there gets up and says,
      &ldquo;There is going to be a great man in Philadelphia, but never was one.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Oh, is that so? When are you going to be great?&rdquo; &ldquo;When I am elected to
      some political office.&rdquo; Young man, won&rsquo;t you learn a lesson in the primer
      of politics that it is a <i>prima facie</i> evidence of littleness to hold
      office under our form of government? Great men get into office sometimes,
      but what this country needs is men that will do what we tell them to do.
      This nation&mdash;where the people rule&mdash;is governed by the people,
      for the people, and so long as it is, then the office-holder is but the
      servant of the people, and the Bible says the servant cannot be greater
      than the master. The Bible says, &ldquo;He that is sent cannot be greater than
      Him who sent Him.&rdquo; The people rule, or should rule, and if they do, we do
      not need the greater men in office. If the great men in America took our
      offices, we would change to an empire in the next ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know of a great many young women, now that woman&rsquo;s suffrage is coming,
      who say, &ldquo;I am going to be President of the United States some day.&rdquo; I
      believe in woman&rsquo;s suffrage, and there is no doubt but what it is coming,
      and I am getting out of the way, anyhow. I may want an office by and by
      myself; but if the ambition for an office influences the women in their
      desire to vote, I want to say right here what I say to the young men, that
      if you only get the privilege of casting one vote, you don&rsquo;t get anything
      that is worth while. Unless you can control more than one vote, you will
      be unknown, and your influence so dissipated as practically not to be
      felt. This country is not run by votes. Do you think it is? It is governed
      by influence. It is governed by the ambitions and the enterprises which
      control votes. The young woman that thinks she is going to vote for the
      sake of holding an office is making an awful blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      That other young man gets up and says, &ldquo;There are going to be great men in
      this country and in Philadelphia.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is that so? When?&rdquo; &ldquo;When there comes a
      great war, when we get into difficulty through watchful waiting in Mexico;
      when we get into war with England over some frivolous deed, or with Japan
      or China or New Jersey or some distant country. Then I will march up to
      the cannon&rsquo;s mouth; I will sweep up among the glistening bayonets; I will
      leap into the arena and tear down the flag and bear it away in triumph. I
      will come home with stars on my shoulder, and hold every office in the
      gift of the nation, and I will be great.&rdquo; No, you won&rsquo;t. You think you are
      going to be made great by an office, but remember that if you are not
      great before you get the office, you won&rsquo;t be great when you secure it. It
      will only be a burlesque in that shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a Peace Jubilee here after the Spanish War. Out West they don&rsquo;t
      believe this, because they said, &ldquo;Philadelphia would not have heard of any
      Spanish War until fifty years hence.&rdquo; Some of you saw the procession go up
      Broad Street. I was away, but the family wrote to me that the tally-ho
      coach with Lieutenant Hobson upon it stopped right at the front door and
      the people shouted, &ldquo;Hurrah for Hobson!&rdquo; and if I had been there I would
      have yelled too, because he deserves much more of his country than he has
      ever received. But suppose I go into school and say, &ldquo;Who sunk the <i>Merrimac</i>
      at Santiago?&rdquo; and if the boys answer me, &ldquo;Hobson,&rdquo; they will tell me
      seven-eighths of a lie. There were seven other heroes on that steamer, and
      they, by virtue of their position, were continually exposed to the Spanish
      fire, while Hobson, as an officer, might reasonably be behind the
      smoke-stack. You have gathered in this house your most intelligent people,
      and yet, perhaps, not one here can name the other seven men.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ought not to so teach history. We ought to teach that, however humble a
      man&rsquo;s station may be, if he does his full duty in that place he is just as
      much entitled to the American people&rsquo;s honor as is the king upon his
      throne. But we do not so teach. We are now teaching everywhere that the
      generals do all the fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that, after the war, I went down to see General Robert E. Lee,
      that magnificent Christian gentleman of whom both North and South are now
      proud as one of our great Americans. The general told me about his
      servant, &ldquo;Rastus,&rdquo; who was an enlisted colored soldier. He called him in
      one day to make fun of him, and said, &ldquo;Rastus, I hear that all the rest of
      your company are killed, and why are you not killed?&rdquo; Rastus winked at him
      and said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause when there is any fightin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; on I stay back with the
      generals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remember another illustration. I would leave it out but for the fact
      that when you go to the library to read this lecture, you will find this
      has been printed in it for twenty-five years. I shut my eyes&mdash;shut
      them close&mdash;and lo! I see the faces of my youth. Yes, they sometimes
      say to me, &ldquo;Your hair is not white; you are working night and day without
      seeming ever to stop; you can&rsquo;t be old.&rdquo; But when I shut my eyes, like any
      other man of my years, oh, then come trooping back the faces of the loved
      and lost of long ago, and I know, whatever men may say, it is
      evening-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shut my eyes now and look back to my native town in Massachusetts, and I
      see the cattle-show ground on the mountain-top; I can see the horse-sheds
      there. I can see the Congregational church; see the town hall and
      mountaineers&rsquo; cottages; see a great assembly of people turning out,
      dressed resplendently, and I can see flags flying and handkerchiefs waving
      and hear bands playing. I can see that company of soldiers that had
      re-enlisted marching up on that cattle-show ground. I was but a boy, but I
      was captain of that company and puffed out with pride. A cambric needle
      would have burst me all to pieces. Then I thought it was the greatest
      event that ever came to man on earth. If you have ever thought you would
      like to be a king or queen, you go and be received by the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bands played, and all the people turned out to receive us. I marched
      up that Common so proud at the head of my troops, and we turned down into
      the town hall. Then they seated my soldiers down the center aisle and I
      sat down on the front seat. A great assembly of people a hundred or two&mdash;came
      in to fill the town hall, so that they stood up all around. Then the town
      officers came in and formed a half-circle. The mayor of the town sat in
      the middle of the platform. He was a man who had never held office before;
      but he was a good man, and his friends have told me that I might use this
      without giving them offense. He was a good man, but he thought an office
      made a man great. He came up and took his seat, adjusted his powerful
      spectacles, and looked around, when he suddenly spied me sitting there on
      the front seat. He came right forward on the platform and invited me up to
      sit with the town officers. No town officer ever took any notice of me
      before I went to war, except to advise the teacher to thrash me, and now I
      was invited up on the stand with the town officers. Oh my! the town mayor
      was then the emperor, the king of our day and our time. As I came up on
      the platform they gave me a chair about this far, I would say, from the
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had got seated, the chairman of the Selectmen arose and came
      forward to the table, and we all supposed he would introduce the
      Congregational minister, who was the only orator in town, and that he
      would give the oration to the returning soldiers. But, friends, you should
      have seen the surprise which ran over the audience when they discovered
      that the old fellow was going to deliver that speech himself. He had never
      made a speech in his life, but he fell into the same error that hundreds
      of other men have fallen into. It seems so strange that a man won&rsquo;t learn
      he must speak his piece as a boy if he in-tends to be an orator when he is
      grown, but he seems to think all he has to do is to hold an office to be a
      great orator.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he came up to the front, and brought with him a speech which he had
      learned by heart walking up and down the pasture, where he had frightened
      the cattle. He brought the manuscript with him and spread it out on the
      table so as to be sure he might see it. He adjusted his spectacles and
      leaned over it for a moment and marched back on that platform, and then
      came forward like this&mdash;tramp, tramp, tramp. He must have studied the
      subject a great deal, when you come to think of it, because he assumed an
      &ldquo;elocutionary&rdquo; attitude. He rested heavily upon his left heel, threw back
      his shoulders, slightly advanced the right foot, opened the organs of
      speech, and advanced his right foot at an angle of forty-five. As he stood
      in that elocutionary attitude, friends, this is just the way that speech
      went. Some people say to me, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you exaggerate?&rdquo; That would be
      impossible. But I am here for the lesson and not for the story, and this
      is the way it went:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow-citizens&mdash;&rdquo; As soon as he heard his voice his fingers began
      to go like that, his knees began to shake, and then he trembled all over.
      He choked and swallowed and came around to the table to look at the
      manuscript. Then he gathered himself up with clenched fists and came back:
      &ldquo;Fellow-citizens, we are Fellow-citizens, we are&mdash;we are&mdash;we are&mdash;we
      are&mdash;we are&mdash;we are very happy&mdash;we are very happy&mdash;we
      are very happy. We are very happy to welcome back to their native town
      these soldiers who have fought and bled&mdash;and come back again to their
      native town. We are especially&mdash;we are especially&mdash;we are
      especially. We are especially pleased to see with us to-day this young
      hero&rdquo; (that meant me)&mdash;&ldquo;this young hero who in imagination&rdquo; (friends,
      remember he said that; if he had not said &ldquo;in imagination&rdquo; I would not be
      egotistic enough to refer to it at all)&mdash;&ldquo;this young hero who in
      imagination we have seen leading&mdash;we have seen leading&mdash;leading.
      We have seen leading his troops on to the deadly breach. We have seen his
      shining&mdash;we have seen his shining&mdash;his shining&mdash;his shining
      sword&mdash;flashing. Flashing in the sunlight, as he shouted to his
      troops, &lsquo;Come on&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh dear, dear, dear! how little that good man knew about war. If he had
      known anything about war at all he ought to have known what any of my G.
      A. R. comrades here to-night will tell you is true, that it is next to a
      crime for an officer of infantry ever in time of danger to go ahead of his
      men. &ldquo;I, with my shining sword flashing in the sunlight, shouting to my
      troops, &lsquo;Come on&rsquo;!&rdquo; I never did it. Do you suppose I would get in front of
      my men to be shot in front by the enemy and in the back by my own men?
      That is no place for an officer. The place for the officer in actual
      battle is behind the line. How often, as a staff officer, I rode down the
      line, when our men were suddenly called to the line of battle, and the
      Rebel yells were coming out of the woods, and shouted: &ldquo;Officers to the
      rear! Officers to the rear!&rdquo; Then every officer gets behind the line of
      private soldiers, and the higher the officer&rsquo;s rank the farther behind he
      goes. Not because he is any the less brave, but because the laws of war
      require that. And yet he shouted, &ldquo;I, with my shining sword&mdash;&rdquo; In
      that house there sat the company of my soldiers who had carried that boy
      across the Carolina rivers that he might not wet his feet. Some of them
      had gone far out to get a pig or a chicken. Some of them had gone to death
      under the shell-swept pines in the mountains of Tennessee, yet in the good
      man&rsquo;s speech they were scarcely known. He did refer to them, but only
      incidentally. The hero of the hour was this boy. Did the nation owe him
      anything? No, nothing then and nothing now. Why was he the hero? Simply
      because that man fell into that same human error&mdash;that this boy was
      great because he was an officer and these were only private soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I learned the lesson then that I will never forget so long as the
      tongue of the bell of time continues to swing for me. Greatness consists
      not in the holding of some future office, but really consists in doing
      great deeds with little means and the accomplishment of vast purposes from
      the private ranks of life. To be great at all one must be great here, now,
      in Philadelphia. He who can give to this city better streets and better
      sidewalks, better schools and more colleges, more happiness and more
      civilization, more of God, he will be great anywhere. Let every man or
      woman here, if you never hear me again, remember this, that if you wish to
      be great at all, you must begin where you are and what you are, in
      Philadelphia, now. He that can give to his city any blessing, he who can
      be a good citizen while he lives here, he that can make better homes, he
      that can be a blessing whether he works in the shop or sits behind the
      counter or keeps house, whatever be his life, he who would be great
      anywhere must first be great in his own Philadelphia.

      I. THE STORY OF THE SWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I SHALL write of a remarkable man, an interesting man, a man of power, of
      initiative, of will, of persistence; a man who plans vastly and who
      realizes his plans; a man who not only does things himself, but who, even
      more important than that, is the constant inspiration of others. I shall
      write of Russell H. Conwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a farmer&rsquo;s boy he was the leader of the boys of the rocky region that
      was his home; as a school-teacher he won devotion; as a newspaper
      correspondent he gained fame; as a soldier in the Civil War he rose to
      important rank; as a lawyer he developed a large practice; as an author he
      wrote books that reached a mighty total of sales. He left the law for the
      ministry and is the active head of a great church that he raised from
      nothingness. He is the most popular lecturer in the world and yearly
      speaks to many thousands. He is, so to speak, the discoverer of &ldquo;Acres of
      Diamonds,&rdquo; through which thousands of men and women have achieved success
      out of failure. He is the head of two hospitals, one of them founded by
      himself, that have cared for a host of patients, both the poor and the
      rich, irrespective of race or creed. He is the founder and head of a
      university that has already had tens of thousands of students. His home is
      in Philadelphia; but he is known in every corner of every state in the
      Union, and everywhere he has hosts of friends. All of his life he has
      helped and inspired others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite by chance, and only yesterday, literally yesterday and by chance,
      and with no thought at the moment of Conwell although he had been much in
      my mind for some time past, I picked up a thin little book of description
      by William Dean Howells, and, turning the pages of a chapter on Lexington,
      old Lexington of the Revolution, written, so Howells had set down, in
      1882, I noticed, after he had written of the town itself, and of the
      long-past fight there, and of the present-day aspect, that he mentioned
      the church life of the place and remarked on the striking advances made by
      the Baptists, who had lately, as he expressed it, been reconstituted out
      of very perishing fragments and made strong and flourishing, under the
      ministrations of a lay preacher, formerly a colonel in the Union army. And
      it was only a few days before I chanced upon this description that Dr.
      Conwell, the former colonel and former lay preacher, had told me of his
      experiences in that little old Revolutionary town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Howells went on to say that, so he was told, the colonel&rsquo;s success was
      principally due to his making the church attractive to young people.
      Howells says no more of him; apparently he did not go to hear him; and one
      wonders if he has ever associated that lay preacher of Lexington with the
      famous Russell H. Conwell of these recent years!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attractive to young people.&rdquo; Yes, one can recognize that to-day, just as
      it was recognized in Lexington. And it may be added that he at the same
      time attracts older people, too! In this, indeed, lies his power. He makes
      his church interesting, his sermons interesting, his lectures interesting.
      He is himself interesting! Because of his being interesting, he gains
      attention. The attention gained, he inspires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biography is more than dates. Dates, after all, are but mile-stones along
      the road of life. And the most important fact of Conwell&rsquo;s life is that he
      lived to be eighty-two, working sixteen hours every day for the good of
      his fellow-men. He was born on February 15, 1843&mdash;born of poor
      parents, in a low-roofed cottage in the eastern Berkshires, in
      Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born in this room,&rdquo; he said to me, simply, as we sat together
      recently <a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a>
      in front of the old fireplace in the principal room of the little cottage;
      for he has bought back the rocky farm of his father, and has retained and
      restored the little old home. &ldquo;I was born in this room. It was bedroom and
      kitchen. It was poverty.&rdquo; And his voice sank with a kind of grimness into
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he spoke a little of the struggles of those long-past years; and we
      went out on the porch, as the evening shadows fell, and looked out over
      the valley and stream and hills of his youth, and he told of his
      grandmother, and of a young Marylander who had come to the region on a
      visit; it was a tale of the impetuous love of those two, of rash marriage,
      of the interference of parents, of the fierce rivalry of another suitor,
      of an attack on the Marylander&rsquo;s life, of passionate hastiness, of
      unforgivable words, of separation, of lifelong sorrow. &ldquo;Why does
      grandmother cry so often?&rdquo; he remembers asking when he was a little boy.
      And he was told that it was for the husband of her youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went back into the little house, and he showed me the room in which he
      first saw John Brown. &ldquo;I came down early one morning, and saw a huge,
      hairy man sprawled upon the bed there&mdash;and I was frightened,&rdquo; he
      says.
    </p>
    <p>
      But John Brown did not long frighten him! For he was much at their house
      after that, and was so friendly with Russell and his brother that there
      was no chance for awe; and it gives a curious side-light on the character
      of the stern abolitionist that he actually, with infinite patience, taught
      the old horse of the Conwells to go home alone with the wagon after
      leaving the boys at school, a mile or more away, and at school-closing
      time to trot gently off for them without a driver when merely faced in
      that direction and told to go! Conwell remembers how John Brown, in
      training it, used patiently to walk beside the horse, and control its
      going and its turnings, until it was quite ready to go and turn entirely
      by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Conwell house was a station on the Underground Railway, and Russell
      Conwell remembers, when a lad, seeing the escaping slaves that his father
      had driven across country and temporarily hidden. &ldquo;Those were heroic
      days,&rdquo; he says, quietly. &ldquo;And once in a while my father let me go with
      him. They were wonderful night drives&mdash;the cowering slaves, the
      darkness of the road, the caution and the silence and dread of it all.&rdquo;
       This underground route, he remembers, was from Philadelphia to New Haven,
      thence to Springfield, where Conwell&rsquo;s father would take his charge, and
      onward to Bellows Falls and Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conwell tells, too, of meeting Frederick Douglass, the colored orator, in
      that little cottage in the hills. &ldquo;&lsquo;I never saw my father,&rsquo; Douglass said
      one day&mdash;his father was a white man&mdash;&lsquo;and I remember little of
      my mother except that once she tried to keep an overseer from whipping me,
      and the lash cut across her own face, and her blood fell over me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When John Brown was captured,&rdquo; Conwell went on, &ldquo;my father tried to sell
      this place to get a little money to send to help his defense. But he
      couldn&rsquo;t sell it, and on the day of the execution we knelt solemnly here,
      from eleven to twelve, just praying, praying in silence for the passing
      soul of John Brown. And as we prayed we knew that others were also
      praying, for a church-bell tolled during that entire hour, and its awesome
      boom went sadly sounding over these hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conwell believes that his real life dates from a happening of the time of
      the Civil War&mdash;a happening that still looms vivid and intense before
      him, and which undoubtedly did deepen and strengthen his strong and deep
      nature. Yet the real Conwell was always essentially the same. Neighborhood
      tradition still tells of his bravery as a boy and a youth, of his reckless
      coasting, his skill as a swimmer and his saving of lives, his strength and
      endurance, his plunging out into the darkness of a wild winter night to
      save a neighbor&rsquo;s cattle. His soldiers came home with tales of his
      devotion to them, and of how he shared his rations and his blankets and
      bravely risked his life; of how he crept off into a swamp, at imminent
      peril, to rescue one of his men lost or mired there. The present Conwell
      was always Conwell; in fact, he may be traced through his ancestry, too,
      for in him are the sturdy virtues, the bravery, the grim determination,
      the practicality, of his father; and romanticism, that comes from his
      grandmother; and the dreamy qualities of his mother, who, practical and
      hardworking New England woman that she was, was at the same time
      influenced by an almost startling mysticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Conwell himself is a dreamer: first of all he is a dreamer; it is the
      most important fact in regard to him! It is because he is a dreamer and
      visualizes his dreams that he can plan the great things that to other men
      would seem impossibilities; and then his intensely practical side his
      intense efficiency, his power, his skill, his patience, his fine
      earnestness, his mastery over others, develop his dreams into realities.
      He dreams dreams and sees visions&mdash;but his visions are never
      visionary and his dreams become facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rocky hills which meant a dogged struggle for very existence, the
      fugitive slaves, John Brown&mdash;what a school for youth! And the literal
      school was a tiny one-room school-house where young Conwell came under the
      care of a teacher who realized the boy&rsquo;s unusual capabilities and was able
      to give him broad and unusual help. Then a wise country preacher also
      recognized the unusual, and urged the parents to give still more
      education, whereupon supreme effort was made and young Russell was sent to
      Wilbraham Academy. He likes to tell of his life there, and of the
      hardships, of which he makes light; and of the joy with which week-end
      pies and cakes were received from home!
    </p>
    <p>
      He tells of how he went out on the roads selling books from house to
      house, and of how eagerly he devoured the contents of the sample books
      that he carried. &ldquo;They were a foundation of learning for me,&rdquo; he says,
      soberly. &ldquo;And they gave me a broad idea of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went to Yale in 1860, but the outbreak of the war interfered with
      college, and he enlisted in 1861. But he was only eighteen, and his father
      objected, and he went back to Yale. But next year he again enlisted, and
      men of his Berkshire neighborhood, likewise enlisting, insisted that he be
      their captain; and Governor Andrews, appealed to, consented to commission
      the nineteen-year-old youth who was so evidently a natural leader; and the
      men gave freely of their scant money to get for him a sword, all gay and
      splendid with gilt, and upon the sword was the declaration in stately
      Latin that, &ldquo;True friendship is eternal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that sword is associated the most vivid, the most momentous
      experience of Russell Conwell&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sword hangs at the head of Conwell&rsquo;s bed in his home in Philadelphia.
      Man of peace that he is, and minister of peace, that symbol of war has for
      over half a century been of infinite importance to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me the story as we stood together before that sword. And as he
      told the story, speaking with quiet repression, but seeing it all and
      living it all just as vividly as if it had occurred but yesterday, &ldquo;That
      sword has meant so much to me,&rdquo; he murmured; and then he began the tale:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boy up there in the Berkshires, a neighbor&rsquo;s son, was John Ring; I call
      him a boy, for we all called him a boy, and we looked upon him as a boy,
      for he was under-sized and under-developed&mdash;so much so that he could
      not enlist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for some reason he was devoted to me, and he not only wanted to
      enlist, but he also wanted to be in the artillery company of which I was
      captain; and I could only take him along as my servant. I didn&rsquo;t want a
      servant, but it was the only way to take poor little Johnnie Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnnie was deeply religious, and would read the Bible every evening
      before turning in. In those days I was an atheist, or at least thought I
      was, and I used to laugh at Ring, and after a while he took to reading the
      Bible outside the tent on account of my laughing at him! But he did not
      stop reading it, and his faithfulness to me remained unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scabbard of the sword was too glittering for the regulations&rdquo;&mdash;the
      ghost of a smile hovered on Conwell&rsquo;s lips&mdash;&ldquo;and I could not wear it,
      and could only wear a plain one for service and keep this hanging in my
      tent on the tent-pole. John Ring used to handle it adoringly, and kept it
      polished to brilliancy.&mdash;It&rsquo;s dull enough these many years,&rdquo; he
      added, somberly. &ldquo;To Ring it represented not only his captain, but the
      very glory and pomp of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day the Confederates suddenly stormed our position near New Berne and
      swept through the camp, driving our entire force before them; and all,
      including my company, retreated hurriedly across the river, setting fire
      to a long wooden bridge as we went over. It soon blazed up furiously,
      making a barrier that the Confederates could not pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, unknown to everybody, and unnoticed, John Ring had dashed back to my
      tent. I think he was able to make his way back because he just looked like
      a mere boy; but however that was, he got past the Confederates into my
      tent and took down, from where it was hanging on the tent-pole, my bright,
      gold-scabbarded sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Ring seized the sword that had long been so precious to him. He
      dodged here and there, and actually managed to gain the bridge just as it
      was beginning to blaze. He started across. The flames were every moment
      getting fiercer, the smoke denser, and now and then, as he crawled and
      staggered on, he leaned for a few seconds far over the edge of the bridge
      in an effort to get air. Both sides saw him; both sides watched his
      terrible progress, even while firing was fiercely kept up from each side
      of the river. And then a Confederate officer&mdash;he was one of General
      Pickett&rsquo;s officers&mdash;ran to the water&rsquo;s edge and waved a white
      handkerchief and the firing ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tell that boy to come back here!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Tell him to come back here
      and we will let him go free!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called this out just as Ring was about to enter upon the worst part of
      the bridge&mdash;the covered part, where there were top and bottom and
      sides of blazing wood. The roar of the flames was so close to Ring that he
      could not hear the calls from either side of the river, and he pushed
      desperately on and disappeared in the covered part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was dead silence except for the crackling of the fire. Not a man
      cried out. All waited in hopeless expectancy. And then came a mighty yell
      from Northerner and Southerner alike, for Johnnie came crawling out of the
      end of the covered way&mdash;he had actually passed through that frightful
      place&mdash;and his clothes were ablaze, and he toppled over and fell into
      shallow water; and in a few moments he was dragged out, unconscious, and
      hurried to a hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lingered for a day or so, still unconscious, and then came to himself
      and smiled a little as he found that the sword for which he had given his
      life had been left beside him. He took it in his arms. He hugged it to his
      breast. He gave a few words of final message for me. And that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conwell&rsquo;s voice had gone thrillingly low as he neared the end, for it was
      all so very, very vivid to him, and his eyes had grown tender and his lips
      more strong and firm. And he fell silent, thinking of that long-ago
      happening, and though he looked down upon the thronging traffic of Broad
      Street, it was clear that he did not see it, and that if the rumbling
      hubbub of sound meant anything to him it was the rumbling of the guns of
      the distant past. When he spoke again it was with a still tenser tone of
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I stood beside the body of John Ring and realized that he had died
      for love of me, I made a vow that has formed my life. I vowed that from
      that moment I would live not only my own life, but that I would also live
      the life of John Ring. And from that moment I have worked sixteen hours
      every day&mdash;eight for John Ring&rsquo;s work and eight hours for my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A curious note had come into his voice, as of one who had run the race and
      neared the goal, fought the good fight and neared the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every morning when I rise I look at this sword, or if I am away from home
      I think of the sword, and vow anew that another day shall see sixteen
      hours of work from me.&rdquo; And when one comes to know Russell Conwell one
      realizes that never did a man work more hard and constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was through John Ring and his giving his life through devotion to me
      that I became a Christian,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;This did not come about
      immediately, but it came before the war was over, and it came through
      faithful Johnnie Ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a little lonely cemetery in the Berkshires, a tiny burying-ground
      on a wind-swept hill, a few miles from Conwell&rsquo;s old home. In this
      isolated burying-ground bushes and vines and grass grow in profusion, and
      a few trees cast a gentle shade; and tree-clad hills go billowing off for
      miles and miles in wild and lonely beauty. And in that lonely little
      graveyard I found the plain stone that marks the resting-place of John
      Ring.

      II. THE BEGINNING AT OLD LEXINGTON
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT is not because he is a minister that Russell Conwell is such a force in
      the world. He went into the ministry because he was sincerely and
      profoundly a Christian, and because he felt that as a minister he could do
      more good in the world than in any other capacity. But being a minister is
      but an incident, so to speak. The important thing is not that he is a
      minister, but that he is himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently I heard a New-Yorker, the head of a great corporation, say: &ldquo;I
      believe that Russell Conwell is doing more good in the world than any man
      who has lived since Jesus Christ.&rdquo; And he said this in serious and
      unexaggerated earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Conwell did not get readily into his life-work. He might have seemed
      almost a failure until he was well on toward forty, for although he kept
      making successes they were not permanent successes, and he did not settle
      himself into a definite line. He restlessly went westward to make his
      home, and then restlessly returned to the East. After the war was over he
      was a lawyer, he was a lecturer, he was an editor, he went around the
      world as a correspondent, he wrote books. He kept making money, and kept
      losing it; he lost it through fire, through investments, through aiding
      his friends. It is probable that the unsettledness of the years following
      the war was due to the unsettling effect of the war itself, which thus, in
      its influence, broke into his mature life after breaking into his years at
      Yale. But however that may be, those seething, changing, stirring years
      were years of vital importance to him, for in the myriad experiences of
      that time he was building the foundation of the Conwell that was to come.
      Abroad he met the notables of the earth. At home he made hosts of friends
      and loyal admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth while noting that as a lawyer he would never take a case,
      either civil or criminal, that he considered wrong. It was basic with him
      that he could not and would not fight on what he thought was the wrong
      side. Only when his client was right would he go ahead!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he laughs, his quiet, infectious, characteristic laugh, as he tells of
      how once he was deceived, for he defended a man, charged with stealing a
      watch, who was so obviously innocent that he took the case in a blaze of
      indignation and had the young fellow proudly exonerated. The next day the
      wrongly accused one came to his office and shamefacedly took out the watch
      that he had been charged with stealing. &ldquo;I want you to send it to the man
      I took it from,&rdquo; he said. And he told with a sort of shamefaced pride of
      how he had got a good old deacon to give, in all sincerity, the evidence
      that exculpated him. &ldquo;And, say, Mr. Conwell&mdash;I want to thank you for
      getting me off&mdash;and I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse my deceiving you&mdash;and&mdash;I
      won&rsquo;t be any worse for not going to jail.&rdquo; And Conwell likes to remember
      that thereafter the young man lived up to the pride of exoneration; and,
      though Conwell does not say it or think it, one knows that it was the
      Conwell influence that inspired to honesty&mdash;for always he is an
      inspirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conwell even kept certain hours for consultation with those too poor to
      pay any fee; and at one time, while still an active lawyer, he was
      guardian for over sixty children! The man has always been a marvel, and
      always one is coming upon such romantic facts as these.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is a curious thing about him&mdash;how much there is of romance in
      his life! Worshiped to the end by John Ring; left for dead all night at
      Kenesaw Mountain; calmly singing &ldquo;Nearer, my God, to Thee,&rdquo; to quiet the
      passengers on a supposedly sinking ship; saving lives even when a boy;
      never disappointing a single audience of the thousands of audiences he has
      arranged to address during all his years of lecturing! He himself takes a
      little pride in this last point, and it is characteristic of him that he
      has actually forgotten that just once he did fail to appear: he has quite
      forgotten that one evening, on his way to a lecture, he stopped a runaway
      horse to save two women&rsquo;s lives, and went in consequence to a hospital
      instead of to the platform! And it is typical of him to forget that sort
      of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The emotional temperament of Conwell has always made him responsive to the
      great, the striking, the patriotic. He was deeply influenced by knowing
      John Brown, and his brief memories of Lincoln are intense, though he saw
      him but three times in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time he saw Lincoln was on the night when the future President
      delivered the address, which afterward became so famous, in Cooper Union,
      New York. The name of Lincoln was then scarcely known, and it was by mere
      chance that young Conwell happened to be in New York on that day. But
      being there, and learning that Abraham Lincoln from the West was going to
      make an address, he went to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tells how uncouthly Lincoln was dressed, even with one trousers-leg
      higher than the other, and of how awkward he was, and of how poorly, at
      first, he spoke and with what apparent embarrassment. The chairman of the
      meeting got Lincoln a glass of water, and Conwell thought that it was from
      a personal desire to help him and keep him from breaking down. But he
      loves to tell how Lincoln became a changed man as he spoke; how he seemed
      to feel ashamed of his brief embarrassment and, pulling himself together
      and putting aside the written speech which he had prepared, spoke freely
      and powerfully, with splendid conviction, as only a born orator speaks. To
      Conwell it was a tremendous experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second time he saw Lincoln was when he went to Washington to plead for
      the life of one of his men who had been condemned to death for sleeping on
      post. He was still but a captain (his promotion to a colonelcy was still
      to come), a youth, and was awed by going into the presence of the man he
      worshiped. And his voice trembles a little, even now, as he tells of how
      pleasantly Lincoln looked up from his desk, and how cheerfully he asked
      his business with him, and of how absorbedly Lincoln then listened to his
      tale, although, so it appeared, he already knew of the main outline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be all right,&rdquo; said Lincoln, when Conwell finished. But Conwell
      was still frightened. He feared that in the multiplicity of public matters
      this mere matter of the life of a mountain boy, a private soldier, might
      be forgotten till too late. &ldquo;It is almost the time set&mdash;&rdquo; he
      faltered. And Conwell&rsquo;s voice almost breaks, man of emotion that he is, as
      he tells of how Lincoln said, with stern gravity: &ldquo;Go and telegraph that
      soldier&rsquo;s mother that Abraham Lincoln never signed a warrant to shoot a
      boy under twenty, and never will.&rdquo; That was the one and only time that he
      spoke with Lincoln, and it remains an indelible impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third time he saw Lincoln was when, as officer of the day, he stood
      for hours beside the dead body of the President as it lay in state in
      Washington. In those hours, as he stood rigidly as the throng went
      shuffling sorrowfully through, an immense impression came to Colonel
      Conwell of the work and worth of the man who there lay dead, and that
      impression has never departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Brown, Abraham Lincoln, old Revolutionary Lexington&mdash;how
      Conwell&rsquo;s life is associated with famous men and places!&mdash;and it was
      actually at Lexington that he made the crucial decision as to the course
      of his life! And it seems to me that it was, although quite unconsciously,
      because of the very fact that it was Lexington that Conwell was influenced
      to decide and to act as he did. Had it been in some other kind of place,
      some merely ordinary place, some quite usual place, he might not have
      taken the important step. But it was Lexington, it was brave old
      Lexington, inspiring Lexington; and he was inspired by it, for the man who
      himself inspires nobly is always the one who is himself open to noble
      inspiration. Lexington inspired him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a lawyer in Boston and almost thirty-seven years old,&rdquo; he told
      me, thinking slowly back into the years, &ldquo;I was consulted by a woman who
      asked my advice in regard to disposing of a little church in Lexington
      whose congregation had become unable to support it. I went out and looked
      at the place, and I told her how the property could be sold. But it seemed
      a pity to me that the little church should be given up. However, I advised
      a meeting of the church members, and I attended the meeting. I put the
      case to them&mdash;it was only a handful of men and women&mdash;and there
      was silence for a little. Then an old man rose and, in a quavering voice,
      said the matter was quite clear; that there evidently was nothing to do
      but to sell, and that he would agree with the others in the necessity; but
      as the church had been his church home from boyhood, so he quavered and
      quivered on, he begged that they would excuse him from actually taking
      part in disposing of it; and in a deep silence he went haltingly from the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men and the women looked at one another, still silent, sadly
      impressed, but not knowing what to do. And I said to them: &lsquo;Why not start
      over again, and go on with the church, after all!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Typical Conwellism, that! First, the impulse to help those who need
      helping, then the inspiration and leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But the building is entirely too tumble-down to use,&rsquo; said one of the
      men, sadly; and I knew he was right, for I had examined it; but I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let us meet there to-morrow morning and get to work on that building
      ourselves and put it in shape for a service next Sunday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It made them seem so pleased and encouraged, and so confident that a new
      possibility was opening that I never doubted that each one of those
      present, and many friends besides, would be at the building in the
      morning. I was there early with a hammer and ax and crowbar that I had
      secured, ready to go to work&mdash;but no one else showed up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He has a rueful appreciation of the humor of it, as he pictured the scene;
      and one knows also that, in that little town of Lexington, where Americans
      had so bravely faced the impossible, Russell Conwell also braced himself
      to face the impossible. A pettier man would instantly have given up the
      entire matter when those who were most interested failed to respond, but
      one of the strongest features in Conwell&rsquo;s character is his ability to
      draw even doubters and weaklings into line, his ability to stir even those
      who have given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked over that building,&rdquo; he goes on, whimsically, &ldquo;and I saw that
      repair really seemed out of the question. Nothing but a new church would
      do! So I took the ax that I had brought with me and began chopping the
      place down. In a little while a man, not one of the church members, came
      along, and he watched me for a time and said, &lsquo;What are you going to do
      there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I instantly replied, &lsquo;Tear down this old building and build a new
      church here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked at me. &lsquo;But the people won&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, they will,&rsquo; I said, cheerfully, keeping at my work. Whereupon he
      watched me a few minutes longer and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you can put me down for one hundred dollars for the new building.
      Come up to my livery-stable and get it this evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll surely be there,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a little while another man came along and stopped and looked, and he
      rather gibed at the idea of a new church, and when I told him of the
      livery-stable man contributing one hundred dollars, he said, &lsquo;But you
      haven&rsquo;t got the money yet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but I am going to get it to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never get it,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not that sort of a man. He&rsquo;s not
      even a church man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I just went quietly on with the work, without answering, and after
      quite a while he left; but he called back, as he went off, &lsquo;Well, if he
      does give you that hundred dollars, come to me and I&rsquo;ll give you another
      hundred.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conwell smiles in genial reminiscence and without any apparent sense that
      he is telling of a great personal triumph, and goes on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those two men both paid the money, and of course the church people
      themselves, who at first had not quite understood that I could be in
      earnest, joined in and helped, with work and money, and as, while the new
      church was building, it was peculiarly important to get and keep the
      congregation together, and as they had ceased to have a minister of their
      own, I used to run out from Boston and preach for them, in a room we
      hired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was there in Lexington, in 1879, that I determined to become a
      minister. I had a good law practice, but I determined to give it up. For
      many years I had felt more or less of a call to the ministry, and here at
      length was the definite time to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Week by week I preached there&rdquo;&mdash;how strange, now, to think of
      William Dean Howells and the colonel-preacher!&mdash;&ldquo;and after a while
      the church was completed, and in that very church, there in Lexington, I
      was ordained a minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A marvelous thing, all this, even without considering the marvelous
      heights that Conwell has since attained&mdash;a marvelous thing, an
      achievement of positive romance! That little church stood for American
      bravery and initiative and self-sacrifice and romanticism in a way that
      well befitted good old Lexington.
    </p>
    <p>
      To leave a large and overflowing law practice and take up the ministry at
      a salary of six hundred dollars a year seemed to the relatives of
      Conwell&rsquo;s wife the extreme of foolishness, and they did not hesitate so to
      express themselves. Naturally enough, they did not have Conwell&rsquo;s vision.
      Yet he himself was fair enough to realize and to admit that there was a
      good deal of fairness in their objections; and so he said to the
      congregation that, although he was quite ready to come for the six hundred
      dollars a year, he expected them to double his salary as soon as he
      doubled the church membership. This seemed to them a good deal like a
      joke, but they answered in perfect earnestness that they would be quite
      willing to do the doubling as soon as he did the doubling, and in less
      than a year the salary was doubled accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him if he had found it hard to give up the lucrative law for a
      poor ministry, and his reply gave a delightful impression of his capacity
      for humorous insight into human nature, for he said, with a genial
      twinkle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, it was a wrench; but there is a sort of romance of
      self-sacrifice, you know. I rather suppose the old-time martyrs rather
      enjoyed themselves in being martyrs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conwell did not stay very long in Lexington. A struggling little church in
      Philadelphia heard of what he was doing, and so an old deacon went up to
      see and hear him, and an invitation was given; and as the Lexington church
      seemed to be prosperously on its feet, and the needs of the Philadelphia
      body keenly appealed to Conwell&rsquo;s imagination, a change was made, and at a
      salary of eight hundred dollars a year he went, in 1882, to the little
      struggling Philadelphia congregation, and of that congregation he is still
      pastor&mdash;only, it ceased to be a struggling congregation a great many
      years ago! And long ago it began paying him more thousands every year than
      at first it gave him hundreds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreamer as Conwell always is in connection with his immense practicality,
      and moved as he is by the spiritual influences of life, it is more than
      likely that not only did Philadelphia&rsquo;s need appeal, but also the fact
      that Philadelphia, as a city, meant much to him, for, coming North,
      wounded from a battle-field of the Civil War, it was in Philadelphia that
      he was cared for until his health and strength were recovered. Thus it
      came that Philadelphia had early become dear to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here is an excellent example of how dreaming great dreams may go
      hand-in-hand with winning superb results. For that little struggling
      congregation now owns and occupies a great new church building that seats
      more people than any other Protestant church in America&mdash;and Dr.
      Conwell fills it!

    <h2>
      III. STORY OF THE FIFTY-SEVEN CENTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      AT every point in Conwell&rsquo;s life one sees that he wins through his
      wonderful personal influence on old and young. Every step forward, every
      triumph achieved, comes not alone from his own enthusiasm, but because of
      his putting that enthusiasm into others. And when I learned how it came
      about that the present church buildings were begun, it was another of
      those marvelous tales of fact that are stranger than any imagination could
      make them. And yet the tale was so simple and sweet and sad and
      unpretending.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Conwell first assumed charge of the little congregation that led
      him to Philadelphia it was really a little church both in its numbers and
      in the size of the building that it occupied, but it quickly became so
      popular under his leadership that the church services and Sunday-school
      services were alike so crowded that there was no room for all who came,
      and always there were people turned from the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon a little girl, who had eagerly wished to go, turned back
      from the Sunday-school door, crying bitterly because they had told her
      that there was no more room. But a tall, black-haired man met her and
      noticed her tears and, stopping, asked why it was that she was crying, and
      she sobbingly replied that it was because they could not let her into the
      Sunday-school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lifted her to my shoulder,&rdquo; says Dr. Conwell, in telling of this; for
      after hearing the story elsewhere I asked him to tell it to me himself,
      for it seemed almost too strange to be true. &ldquo;I lifted her to my shoulder&rdquo;&mdash;and
      one realizes the pretty scene it must have made for the little girl to go
      through the crowd of people, drying her tears and riding proudly on the
      shoulders of the kindly, tall, dark man! &ldquo;I said to her that I would take
      her in, and I did so, and I said to her that we should some day have a
      room big enough for all who should come. And when she went home she told
      her parents&mdash;I only learned this afterward&mdash;that she was going
      to save money to help build the larger church and Sunday-school that Dr.
      Conwell wanted! Her parents pleasantly humored her in the idea and let her
      run errands and do little tasks to earn pennies, and she began dropping
      the pennies into her bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a lovable little thing&mdash;but in only a few weeks after that
      she was taken suddenly ill and died; and at the funeral her father told
      me, quietly, of how his little girl had been saving money for a
      building-fund. And there, at the funeral, he handed me what she had saved&mdash;just
      fifty-seven cents in pennies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Conwell does not say how deeply he was moved; he is, after all, a man
      of very few words as to his own emotions. But a deep tenderness had crept
      into his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a meeting of the church trustees I told of this gift of fifty-seven
      cents&mdash;the first gift toward the proposed building-fund of the new
      church that was some time to exist. For until then the matter had barely
      been spoken of, as a new church building had been simply a possibility for
      the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trustees seemed much impressed, and it turned out that they were far
      more impressed than I could possibly have hoped, for in a few days one of
      them came to me and said that he thought it would be an excellent idea to
      buy a lot on Broad Street&mdash;the very lot on which the building now
      stands.&rdquo; It was characteristic of Dr. Conwell that he did not point out,
      what every one who knows him would understand, that it was his own
      inspiration put into the trustees which resulted in this quick and
      definite move on the part of one of them. &ldquo;I talked the matter over with
      the owner of the property, and told him of the beginning of the fund, the
      story of the little girl. The man was not one of our church, nor in fact,
      was he a church-goer at all, but he listened attentively to the tale of
      the fifty-seven cents and simply said he was quite ready to go ahead and
      sell us that piece of land for ten thousand dollars, taking&mdash;and the
      unexpectedness of this deeply touched me taking a first payment of just
      fifty-seven cents and letting the entire balance stand on a five-per-cent.
      mortgage!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it seemed to me that it would be the right thing to accept this
      unexpectedly liberal proposition, and I went over the entire matter on
      that basis with the trustees and some of the other members, and all the
      people were soon talking of having a new church. But it was not done in
      that way, after all, for, fine though that way would have been, there was
      to be one still finer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long after my talk with the man who owned the land, and his
      surprisingly good-hearted proposition, an exchange was arranged for me one
      evening with a Mount Holly church, and my wife went with me. We came back
      late, and it was cold and wet and miserable, but as we approached our home
      we saw that it was all lighted from top to bottom, and it was clear that
      it was full of people. I said to my wife that they seemed to be having a
      better time than we had had, and we went in, curious to know what it was
      all about. And it turned out that our absence had been intentionally
      arranged, and that the church people had gathered at our home to meet us
      on our return. And I was utterly amazed, for the spokesman told me that
      the entire ten thousand dollars had been raised and that the land for the
      church that I wanted was free of debt. And all had come so quickly and
      directly from that dear little girl&rsquo;s fifty-seven cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doesn&rsquo;t it seem like a fairy tale! But then this man has all his life been
      making fairy tales into realities. He inspired the child. He inspired the
      trustees. He inspired the owner of the land. He inspired the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The building of the great church&mdash;the Temple Baptist Church, as it is
      termed&mdash;was a great undertaking for the congregation; even though it
      had been swiftly growing from the day of Dr. Conwell&rsquo;s taking charge of
      it, it was something far ahead of what, except in the eyes of an
      enthusiast, they could possibly complete and pay for and support. Nor was
      it an easy task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ground was broken for the building in 1889, in 1891 it was opened for
      worship, and then came years of raising money to clear it. But it was long
      ago placed completely out of debt, and with only a single large
      subscription&mdash;one of ten thousand dollars&mdash;for the church is not
      in a wealthy neighborhood, nor is the congregation made up of the great
      and rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church is built of stone, and its interior is a great amphitheater.
      Special attention has been given to fresh air and light; there is nothing
      of the dim, religious light that goes with medieval churchliness. Behind
      the pulpit are tiers of seats for the great chorus choir. There is a large
      organ. The building is peculiarly adapted for hearing and seeing, and if
      it is not, strictly speaking, beautiful in itself, it is beautiful when it
      is filled with encircling rows of men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man of feeling that he is, and one who appreciates the importance of
      symbols, Dr. Conwell had a heart of olive-wood built into the front of the
      pulpit, for the wood was from an olive-tree in the Garden of Gethsemane.
      And the amber-colored tiles in the inner walls of the church bear, under
      the glaze, the names of thousands of his people; for every one, young or
      old, who helped in the building, even to the giving of a single dollar,
      has his name inscribed there. For Dr. Conwell wished to show that it is
      not only the house of the Lord, but also, in a keenly personal sense, the
      house of those who built it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church has a possible seating capacity of 4,200, although only 3,135
      chairs have been put in it, for it has been the desire not to crowd the
      space needlessly. There is also a great room for the Sunday-school, and
      extensive rooms for the young men&rsquo;s association, the young women&rsquo;s
      association, and for a kitchen, for executive offices, for meeting-places
      for church officers and boards and committees. It is a spacious and
      practical and complete church home, and the people feel at home there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see again,&rdquo; said Dr. Conwell, musingly, &ldquo;the advantage of aiming at
      big things. That building represents $109,000 above ground. It is free
      from debt. Had we built a small church, it would now be heavily
      mortgaged.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IV. HIS POWER AS ORATOR AND PREACHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      EVEN as a young man Conwell won local fame as an orator. At the outbreak
      of the Civil War he began making patriotic speeches that gained
      enlistments. After going to the front he was sent back home for a time, on
      furlough, to make more speeches to draw more recruits, for his speeches
      were so persuasive, so powerful, so full of homely and patriotic feeling,
      that the men who heard them thronged into the ranks. And as a preacher he
      uses persuasion, power, simple and homely eloquence, to draw men to the
      ranks of Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is an orator born, and has developed this inborn power by the hardest
      of study and thought and practice. He is one of those rare men who always
      seize and hold the attention. When he speaks, men listen. It is quality,
      temperament, control&mdash;the word is immaterial, but the fact is very
      material indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some quarter of a century ago Conwell published a little book for students
      on the study and practice of oratory. That &ldquo;clear-cut articulation is the
      charm of eloquence&rdquo; is one of his insisted-upon statements, and it well
      illustrates the lifelong practice of the man himself, for every word as he
      talks can be heard in every part of a large building, yet always he speaks
      without apparent effort. He avoids &ldquo;elocution.&rdquo; His voice is soft-pitched
      and never breaks, even now when he is over seventy, because, so he
      explains it, he always speaks in his natural voice. There is never a
      straining after effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A speaker must possess a large-hearted regard for the welfare of his
      audience,&rdquo; he writes, and here again we see Conwell explaining Conwellism.
      &ldquo;Enthusiasm invites enthusiasm,&rdquo; is another of his points of importance;
      and one understands that it is by deliberate purpose, and not by chance,
      that he tries with such tremendous effort to put enthusiasm into his
      hearers with every sermon and every lecture that he delivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy to raise a laugh, but dangerous, for it is the greatest test
      of an orator&rsquo;s control of his audience to be able to land them again on
      the solid earth of sober thinking.&rdquo; I have known him at the very end of a
      sermon have a ripple of laughter sweep freely over the entire
      congregation, and then in a moment he has every individual under his
      control, listening soberly to his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never fears to use humor, and it is always very simple and obvious and
      effective. With him even a very simple pun may be used, not only with-out
      taking away from the strength of what he is saying, but with a vivid
      increase of impressiveness. And when he says something funny it is in such
      a delightful and confidential way, with such a genial, quiet, infectious
      humorousness, that his audience is captivated. And they never think that
      he is telling something funny of his own; it seems, such is the skill of
      the man, that he is just letting them know of something humorous that they
      are to enjoy with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be absolutely truthful and scrupulously clear,&rdquo; he writes; and with
      delightfully terse common sense, he says, &ldquo;Use illustrations that
      illustrate&rdquo;&mdash;and never did an orator live up to this injunction more
      than does Conwell himself. Nothing is more surprising, nothing is more
      interesting, than the way in which he makes use as illustrations of the
      impressions and incidents of his long and varied life, and, whatever it
      is, it has direct and instant bearing on the progress of his discourse. He
      will refer to something that he heard a child say in a train yesterday; in
      a few minutes he will speak of something that he saw or some one whom he
      met last month, or last year, or ten years ago&mdash;in Ohio, in
      California, in London, in Paris, in New York, in Bombay; and each memory,
      each illustration, is a hammer with which he drives home a truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast number of places he has visited and people he has met, the
      infinite variety of things his observant eyes have seen, give him his
      ceaseless flow of illustrations, and his memory and his skill make
      admirable use of them. It is seldom that he uses an illustration from what
      he has read; everything is, characteristically, his own. Henry M. Stanley,
      who knew him well, referred to him as &ldquo;that double-sighted Yankee,&rdquo; who
      could &ldquo;see at a glance all there is and all there ever was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And never was there a man who so supplements with personal reminiscence
      the place or the person that has figured in the illustration. When he
      illustrates with the story of the discovery of California gold at Sutter&rsquo;s
      he almost parenthetically remarks, &ldquo;I delivered this lecture on that very
      spot a few years ago; that is, in the town that arose on that very spot.&rdquo;
       And when he illustrates by the story of the invention of the
      sewing-machine, he adds: &ldquo;I suppose that if any of you were asked who was
      the inventor of the sewing-machine, you would say that it was Elias Howe.
      But that would be a mistake. I was with Elias Howe in the Civil War, and
      he often used to tell me how he had tried for fourteen years to invent the
      sewing-machine and that then his wife, feeling that something really had
      to be done, invented it in a couple of hours.&rdquo; Listening to him, you begin
      to feel in touch with everybody and everything, and in a friendly and
      intimate way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always, whether in the pulpit or on the platform, as in private
      conversation, there is an absolute simplicity about the man and his words;
      a simplicity, an earnestness, a complete honesty. And when he sets down,
      in his book on oratory, &ldquo;A man has no right to use words carelessly,&rdquo; he
      stands for that respect for word-craftsmanship that every successful
      speaker or writer must feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be intensely in earnest,&rdquo; he writes; and in writing this he sets down a
      prime principle not only of his oratory, but of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young minister told me that Dr. Conwell once said to him, with deep
      feeling, &ldquo;Always remember, as you preach, that you are striving to save at
      least one soul with every sermon.&rdquo; And to one of his close friends Dr.
      Conwell said, in one of his self-revealing conversations:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel, whenever I preach, that there is always one person in the
      congregation to whom, in all probability, I shall never preach again, and
      therefore I feel that I must exert my utmost power in that last chance.&rdquo;
       And in this, even if this were all, one sees why each of his sermons is so
      impressive, and why his energy never lags. Always, with him, is the
      feeling that he is in the world to do all the good he can possibly do; not
      a moment, not an opportunity, must be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he rises and steps to the front of his pulpit he has the
      attention of every one in the building, and this attention he closely
      holds till he is through. Yet it is never by a striking effort that
      attention is gained, except in so far that his utter simplicity is
      striking. &ldquo;I want to preach so simply that you will not think it
      preaching, but just that you are listening to a friend,&rdquo; I remember his
      saying, one Sunday morning, as he began his sermon; and then he went on
      just as simply as such homely, kindly, friendly words promised. And how
      effectively!
    </p>
    <p>
      He believes that everything should be so put as to be understood by all,
      and this belief he applies not only to his preaching, but to the reading
      of the Bible, whose descriptions he not only visualizes to himself, but
      makes vividly clear to his hearers; and this often makes for fascination
      in result.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, he is reading the tenth chapter of I Samuel, and begins,
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thou shalt meet a company of prophets.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Singers,&rsquo; it should be translated,&rdquo; he puts in, lifting his eyes from
      the page and looking out over his people. Then he goes on, taking this
      change as a matter of course, &ldquo;&lsquo;Thou shalt meet a company of singers
      coming down from the high place&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon he again interrupts himself, and in an irresistible explanatory
      aside, which instantly raises the desired picture in the mind of every
      one, he says: &ldquo;That means, from the little old church on the hill, you
      know.&rdquo; And how plain and clear and real and interesting&mdash;most of all,
      interesting&mdash;it is from this moment! Another man would have left it
      that prophets were coming down from a high place, which would not have
      seemed at all alive or natural, and here, suddenly, Conwell has flashed
      his picture of the singers coming down from the little old church on the
      hill! There is magic in doing that sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he goes on, now reading: &ldquo;&lsquo;Thou shalt meet a company of singers coming
      down from the little old church on the hill, with a psaltery, and a
      tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, and they shall sing.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Music is one of Conwell&rsquo;s strongest aids. He sings himself; sings as if he
      likes to sing, and often finds himself leading the singing&mdash;usually
      so, indeed, at the prayer-meetings, and often, in effect, at the church
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember at one church service that the choir-leader was standing in
      front of the massed choir ostensibly leading the singing, but that Conwell
      himself, standing at the rear of the pulpit platform, with his eyes on his
      hymn-book, silently swaying a little with the music and unconsciously
      beating time as he swayed, was just as unconsciously the real leader, for
      it was he whom the congregation were watching and with him that they were
      keeping time! He never suspected it; he was merely thinking along with the
      music; and there was such a look of contagious happiness on his face as
      made every one in the building similarly happy. For he possesses a
      mysterious faculty of imbuing others with his own happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only singers, but the modern equivalent of psaltery and tabret and
      cymbals, all have their place in Dr. Conwell&rsquo;s scheme of church service;
      for there may be a piano, and there may even be a trombone, and there is a
      great organ to help the voices, and at times there are chiming bells. His
      musical taste seems to tend toward the thunderous&mdash;or perhaps it is
      only that he knows there are times when people like to hear the thunderous
      and are moved by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how the choir themselves like it! They occupy a great curving space
      behind the pulpit, and put their hearts into song. And as the congregation
      disperse and the choir filter down, sometimes they are still singing and
      some of them continue to sing as they go slowly out toward the doors. They
      are happy&mdash;Conwell himself is happy&mdash;all the congregation are
      happy. He makes everybody feel happy in coming to church; he makes the
      church attractive just as Howells was so long ago told that he did in
      Lexington.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there is something more than happiness; there is a sense of ease, of
      comfort, of general joy, that is quite unmistakable. There is nothing of
      stiffness or constraint. And with it all there is full reverence. It is no
      wonder that he is accustomed to fill every seat of the great building.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gestures are usually very simple. Now and then, when he works up to
      emphasis, he strikes one fist in the palm of the other hand. When he is
      through you do not remember that he has made any gestures at all, but the
      sound of his voice remains with you, and the look of his wonderful eyes.
      And though he is past the threescore years and ten, he looks out over his
      people with eyes that still have the veritable look of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all great men, he not only does big things, but keeps in touch with
      myriad details. When his assistant, announcing the funeral of an old
      member, hesitates about the street and number and says that they can be
      found in the telephone directory, Dr. Conwell&rsquo;s deep voice breaks quietly
      in with, &ldquo;Such a number [giving it], Dauphin Street&rdquo;&mdash;quietly, and in
      a low tone, yet every one in the church hears distinctly every syllable of
      that low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fund of personal anecdote, or personal reminiscence, is constant and
      illustrative in his preaching, just as it is when he lectures, and the
      reminiscences sweep through many years, and at times are really startling
      in the vivid and homelike pictures they present of the famous folk of the
      past that he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday evening he made an almost casual reference to the time when he
      first met Garfield, then a candidate for the Presidency. &ldquo;I asked Major
      McKinley, whom I had met in Washington, and whose home was in northern
      Ohio, as was that of Mr. Garfield, to go with me to Mr. Garfield&rsquo;s home
      and introduce me. When we got there, a neighbor had to find him. &lsquo;Jim!
      Jim!&rsquo; he called. You see, Garfield was just plain Jim to his old
      neighbors. It&rsquo;s hard to recognize a hero over your back fence!&rdquo; He paused
      a moment for the appreciative ripple to subside, and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We three talked there together&rdquo;&mdash;what a rare talking that must have
      been-McKinley, Garfield, and Conwell&mdash;&ldquo;we talked together, and after
      a while we got to the subject of hymns, and those two great men both told
      me how deeply they loved the old hymn, &lsquo;The Old-Time Religion.&rsquo; Garfield
      especially loved it, so he told us, because the good old man who brought
      him up as a boy and to whom he owed such gratitude, used to sing it at the
      pasture bars outside of the boy&rsquo;s window every morning, and young Jim
      knew, whenever he heard that old tune, that it meant it was time for him
      to get up. He said that he had heard the best concerts and the finest
      operas in the world, but had never heard anything he loved as he still
      loved &lsquo;The Old-Time Religion.&rsquo; I forget what reason there was for
      McKinley&rsquo;s especially liking it, but he, as did Garfield, liked it
      immensely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What followed was a striking example of Conwell&rsquo;s intentness on losing no
      chance to fix an impression on his hearers&rsquo; minds, and at the same time it
      was a really astonishing proof of his power to move and sway. For a new
      expression came over his face, and he said, as if the idea had only at
      that moment occurred to him&mdash;as it most probably had&mdash;&ldquo;I think
      it&rsquo;s in our hymnal!&rdquo; And in a moment he announced the number, and the
      great organ struck up, and every person in the great church every man,
      woman, and child&mdash;joined in the swinging rhythm of verse after verse,
      as if they could never tire, of &ldquo;The Old-Time Religion.&rdquo; It is a simple
      melody&mdash;barely more than a single line of almost monotone music:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  <i>It was good enough for mother and it&rsquo;s good enough for me!
  It was good on the fiery furnace and it&rsquo;s good enough for me!</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus it went on, with never-wearying iteration, and each time with the
      refrain, more and more rhythmic and swaying:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>The old-time religion,
   The old-time religion,
   The old-time religion&mdash;
   It&rsquo;s good enough for me!</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      That it was good for the Hebrew children, that it was good for Paul and
      Silas, that it will help you when you&rsquo;re dying, that it will show the way
      to heaven&mdash;all these and still other lines were sung, with a sort of
      wailing softness, a curious monotone, a depth of earnestness. And the man
      who had worked this miracle of control by evoking out of the past his
      memory of a meeting with two of the vanished great ones of the earth,
      stood before his people, leading them, singing with them, his eyes aglow
      with an inward light. His magic had suddenly set them into the spirit of
      the old camp-meeting days, the days of pioneering and hardship, when
      religion meant so much to everybody, and even those who knew nothing of
      such things felt them, even if but vaguely. Every heart was moved and
      touched, and that old tune will sing in the memory of all who thus heard
      it and sung it as long as they live.

    <h2>
      V. GIFT FOR INSPIRING OTHERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE constant earnestness of Conwell, his desire to let no chance slip by
      of helping a fellowman, puts often into his voice, when he preaches, a
      note of eagerness, of anxiety. But when he prays, when he turns to God,
      his manner undergoes a subtle and unconscious change. A load has slipped
      off his shoulders and has been assumed by a higher power. Into his
      bearing, dignified though it was, there comes an unconscious increase of
      the dignity. Into his voice, firm as it was before, there comes a deeper
      note of firmness. He is apt to fling his arms widespread as he prays, in a
      fine gesture that he never uses at other times, and he looks upward with
      the dignity of a man who, talking to a higher being, is proud of being a
      friend and confidant. One does not need to be a Christian to appreciate
      the beauty and fineness of Conwell&rsquo;s prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is likely at any time to do the unexpected, and he is so great a man
      and has such control that whatever he does seems to everybody a perfectly
      natural thing. His sincerity is so evident, and whatever he does is done
      so simply and naturally, that it is just a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember, during one church service, while the singing was going on,
      that he suddenly rose from his chair and, kneeling beside it, on the open
      pulpit, with his back to the congregation, remained in that posture for
      several minutes. No one thought it strange. I was likely enough the only
      one who noticed it. His people are used to his sincerities. And this time
      it was merely that he had a few words to say quietly to God and turned
      aside for a few moments to say them.
    </p>
    <p>
      His earnestness of belief in prayer makes him a firm believer in answers
      to prayer, and, in fact, to what may be termed the direct interposition of
      Providence. Doubtless the mystic strain inherited from his mother has also
      much to do with this. He has a typically homely way of expressing it by
      one of his favorite maxims, one that he loves to repeat encouragingly to
      friends who are in difficulties themselves or who know of the difficulties
      that are his; and this heartening maxim is, &ldquo;Trust in God and do the next
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At one time in the early days of his church work in Philadelphia a payment
      of a thousand dollars was absolutely needed to prevent a law-suit in
      regard to a debt for the church organ. In fact, it was worse than a debt;
      it was a note signed by himself personally, that had become due&mdash;he
      was always ready to assume personal liability for debts of his church&mdash;and
      failure to meet the note would mean a measure of disgrace as well as
      marked church discouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had tried all the sources that seemed open to him, but in vain. He
      could not openly appeal to the church members, in this case, for it was in
      the early days of his pastorate, and his zeal for the organ, his desire
      and determination to have it, as a necessary part of church equipment, had
      outrun the judgment of some of his best friends, including that of the
      deacon who had gone to Massachusetts for him. They had urged a delay till
      other expenses were met, and he had acted against their advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had tried such friends as he could, and he had tried prayer. But there
      was no sign of aid, whether supernatural or natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, literally on the very day on which the holder of the note was to
      begin proceedings against him, a check for precisely the needed one
      thousand dollars came to him, by mail, from a man in the West&mdash;a man
      who was a total stranger to him. It turned out that the man&rsquo;s sister, who
      was one of the Temple membership, had written to her brother of Dr.
      Conwell&rsquo;s work. She knew nothing of any special need for money, knew
      nothing whatever of any note or of the demand for a thousand dollars; she
      merely outlined to her brother what Dr. Conwell was accomplishing, and
      with such enthusiasm that the brother at once sent the opportune check.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a later time the sum of ten thousand dollars was importunately needed.
      It was due, payment had been promised. It was for some of the construction
      work of the Temple University buildings. The last day had come, and
      Conwell and the very few who knew of the emergency were in the depths of
      gloom. It was too large a sum to ask the church people to make up, for
      they were not rich and they had already been giving splendidly, of their
      slender means, for the church and then for the university. There was no
      rich man to turn to; the men famous for enormous charitable gifts have
      never let themselves be interested in any of the work of Russell Conwell.
      It would be unkind and gratuitous to suggest that it has been because
      their names could not be personally attached, or because the work is of an
      unpretentious kind among unpretentious people; it need merely be said that
      neither they nor their agents have cared to aid, except that one of the
      very richest, whose name is the most distinguished in the entire world as
      a giver, did once, in response to a strong personal application, give
      thirty-five hundred dollars, this being the extent of the association of
      the wealthy with any of the varied Conwell work.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when it was absolutely necessary to have ten thousand dollars the
      possibilities of money had been exhausted, whether from congregation or
      individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Russell Conwell, in spite of his superb optimism, is also a man of deep
      depressions, and this is because of the very fire and fervor of his
      nature, for always in such a nature there is a balancing. He believes in
      success; success must come!&mdash;success is in itself almost a religion
      with him&mdash;success for himself and for all the world who will try for
      it! But there are times when he is sad and doubtful over some particular
      possibility. And he intensely believes in prayer&mdash;faith can move
      mountains; but always he believes that it is better not to wait for the
      mountains thus to be moved, but to go right out and get to work at moving
      them. And once in a while there comes a time when the mountain looms too
      threatening, even after the bravest efforts and the deepest trust. Such a
      time had come&mdash;the ten-thousand-dollar debt was a looming mountain
      that he had tried in vain to move. He could still pray, and he did, but it
      was one of the times when he could only think that something had gone
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dean of the university, who has been closely in touch with all his
      work for many years, told me of how, in a discouragement which was the
      more notable through contrast with his usual unfailing courage, he left
      the executive offices for his home, a couple of blocks away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went away with everything looking dark before him. It was
      Christmas-time, but the very fact of its being Christmas only added to his
      depression&mdash;Christmas was such an unnatural time for unhappiness! But
      in a few minutes he came flying back, radiant, overjoyed, sparkling with
      happiness, waving a slip of paper in his hand which was a check for
      precisely ten thousand dollars! For he had just drawn it out of an
      envelope handed to him, as he reached home, by the mail-carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it had come so strangely and so naturally! For the check was from a
      woman who was profoundly interested in his work, and who had sent the
      check knowing that in a general way it was needed, but without the least
      idea that there was any immediate need. That was eight or nine years ago,
      but although the donor was told at the time that Dr. Conwell and all of us
      were most grateful for the gift, it was not until very recently that she
      was told how opportune it was. And the change it made in Dr. Conwell! He
      is a great man for maxims, and all of us who are associated with him know
      that one of his favorites is that &lsquo;It will all come out right some time!&rsquo; 
      And of course we had a rare opportunity to tell him that he ought never to
      be discouraged. And it is so seldom that he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the big new church was building the members of the church were
      vaguely disturbed by noticing, when the structure reached the second
      story, that at that height, on the side toward the vacant and unbought
      land adjoining, there were several doors built that opened literally into
      nothing but space!
    </p>
    <p>
      When asked about these doors and their purpose, Dr. Conwell would make
      some casual reply, generally to the effect that they might be excellent as
      fire-escapes. To no one, for quite a while, did he broach even a hint of
      the great plan that was seething in his mind, which was that the buildings
      of a university were some day to stand on that land immediately adjoining
      the church!
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time the university, the Temple University as it is now called,
      was not even a college, although it was probably called a college. Conwell
      had organized it, and it consisted of a number of classes and teachers,
      meeting in highly inadequate quarters in two little houses. But the
      imagination of Conwell early pictured great new buildings with
      accommodations for thousands! In time the dream was realized, the
      imagination became a fact, and now those second-floor doors actually open
      from the Temple Church into the Temple University!
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, he always thinks big! He dreams big dreams and wins big success.
      All his life he has talked and preached success, and it is a real and very
      practical belief with him that it is just as easy to do a large thing as a
      small one, and, in fact, a little easier! And so he naturally does not see
      why one should be satisfied with the small things of life. &ldquo;If your rooms
      are big the people will come and fill them,&rdquo; he likes to say. The same
      effort that wins a small success would, rightly directed, have won a great
      success. &ldquo;Think big things and then do them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most favorite of all maxims with this man of maxims, is &ldquo;Let Patience have
      her perfect work.&rdquo; Over and over he loves to say it, and his friends laugh
      about his love for it, and he knows that they do and laughs about it
      himself. &ldquo;I tire them all,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;for they hear me say it every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he says it every day because it means so much to him. It stands, in
      his mind, as a constant warning against anger or impatience or over-haste&mdash;faults
      to which his impetuous temperament is prone, though few have ever seen him
      either angry or impatient or hasty, so well does he exercise self-control.
      Those who have long known him well have said to me that they have never
      heard him censure any one; that his forbearance and kindness are
      wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a sensitive man beneath his composure; he has suffered, and keenly,
      when he has been unjustly attacked; he feels pain of that sort for a long
      time, too, for even the passing of years does not entirely deaden it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have been hurt, or when I have talked with annoying cranks, I have
      tried to let Patience have her perfect work, for those very people, if you
      have patience with them, may afterward be of help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went on to talk a little of his early years in Philadelphia, and he
      said, with sadness, that it had pained him to meet with opposition, and
      that it had even come from ministers of his own denomination, for he had
      been so misunderstood and misjudged; but, he added, the momentary
      somberness lifting, even his bitter enemies had been won over with
      patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could understand a good deal of what he meant, for one of the Baptist
      ministers of Philadelphia had said to me, with some shame, that at first
      it used actually to be the case that when Dr. Conwell would enter one of
      the regular ministers&rsquo; meetings, all would hold aloof, not a single one
      stepping forward to meet or greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was all through our jealousy of his success,&rdquo; said the minister,
      vehemently. &ldquo;He came to this city a stranger, and he won instant
      popularity, and we couldn&rsquo;t stand it, and so we pounced upon things that
      he did that were altogether unimportant. The rest of us were so jealous of
      his winning throngs that we couldn&rsquo;t see the good in him. And it hurt Dr.
      Conwell so much that for ten years he did not come to our conferences. But
      all this was changed long ago. Now no minister is so welcomed as he is,
      and I don&rsquo;t believe that there ever has been a single time since he
      started coming again that he hasn&rsquo;t been asked to say something to us. We
      got over our jealousy long ago and we all love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor is it only that the clergymen of his own denomination admire him, for
      not long ago, such having been Dr. Conwell&rsquo;s triumph in the city of his
      adoption, the rector of the most powerful and aristocratic church in
      Philadelphia voluntarily paid lofty tribute to his aims and ability, his
      work and his personal worth. &ldquo;He is an inspiration to his brothers in the
      ministry of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; so this Episcopalian rector wrote. &ldquo;He is a
      friend to all that is good, a foe to all that is evil, a strength to the
      weak, a comforter to the sorrowing, a man of God. These words come from
      the heart of one who loves, honors, and reverences him for his character
      and his deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Conwell did some beautiful and unusual things in his church,
      instituted some beautiful and unusual customs, and one can see how narrow
      and hasty criticisms charged him, long ago, with sensationalism&mdash;charges
      long since forgotten except through the hurt still felt by Dr. Conwell
      himself. &ldquo;They used to charge me with making a circus of the church&mdash;as
      if it were possible for me to make a circus of the church!&rdquo; And his tone
      was one of grieved amazement after all these years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was original and he was popular, and therefore there were
      misunderstanding and jealousy. His Easter services, for example, years
      ago, became widely talked of and eagerly anticipated because each sermon
      would be wrought around some fine symbol; and he would hold in his hand,
      in the pulpit, the blue robin&rsquo;s egg, or the white dove, or the stem of
      lilies, or whatever he had chosen as the particular symbol for the
      particular sermon, and that symbol would give him the central thought for
      his discourse, accented as it would be by the actual symbol itself in view
      of the congregation. The cross lighted by electricity, to shine down over
      the baptismal pool, the little stream of water cascading gently down the
      steps of the pool during the baptismal rite, the roses floating in the
      pool and his gift of one of them to each of the baptized as he or she left
      the water&mdash;all such things did seem, long ago, so unconventional. Yet
      his own people recognized the beauty and poetry of them, and thousands of
      Bibles in Philadelphia have a baptismal rose from Dr. Conwell pressed
      within the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      His constant individuality of mind, his constant freshness, alertness,
      brilliancy, warmth, sympathy, endear him to his congregation, and when he
      returns from an absence they bubble and effervesce over him as if he were
      some brilliant new preacher just come to them. He is always new to them.
      Were it not that he possesses some remarkable quality of charm he would
      long ago have become, so to speak, an old story, but instead of that he is
      to them an always new story, an always entertaining and delightful story,
      after all these years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not only that they still throng to hear him either preach or
      lecture, though that itself would be noticeable, but it is the delightful
      and delighted spirit with which they do it. Just the other evening I heard
      him lecture in his own church, just after his return from an absence, and
      every face beamed happily up at him to welcome him back, and every one
      listened as intently to his every word as if he had never been heard there
      before; and when the lecture was over a huge bouquet of flowers was handed
      up to him, and some one embarrassedly said a few words about its being
      because he was home again. It was all as if he had just returned from an
      absence of months&mdash;and he had been away just five and a half days!

    <h2>
      VI. MILLIONS OF HEARERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      THAT Conwell is not primarily a minister&mdash;that he is a minister
      because he is a sincere Christian, but that he is first of all an Abou Ben
      Adhem, a man who loves his fellow-men, becomes more and more apparent as
      the scope of his life-work is recognized. One almost comes to think that
      his pastorate of a great church is even a minor matter beside the combined
      importance of his educational work, his lecture work, his hospital work,
      his work in general as a helper to those who need help.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my own part, I should say that he is like some of the old-time
      prophets, the strong ones who found a great deal to attend to in addition
      to matters of religion. The power, the ruggedness, the physical and mental
      strength, the positive grandeur of the man&mdash;all these are like the
      general conceptions of the big Old Testament prophets. The suggestion is
      given only because it has often recurred, and therefore with the feeling
      that there is something more than fanciful in the com-parison; and yet,
      after all, the comparison fails in one important particular, for none of
      the prophets seems to have had a sense of humor!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps better and more accurate to describe him as the last of the
      old school of American philosophers, the last of those sturdy-bodied,
      high-thinking, achieving men who, in the old days, did their best to set
      American humanity in the right path&mdash;such men as Emerson, Alcott,
      Gough, Wendell Phillips, Garrison, Bayard Taylor, Beecher; men whom
      Conwell knew and admired in the long ago, and all of whom have long since
      passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Conwell, in his going up and down the country, inspiring his thousands
      and thousands, is the survivor of that old-time group who used to travel
      about, dispensing wit and wisdom and philosophy and courage to the crowded
      benches of country lyceums, and the chairs of school-houses and town
      halls, or the larger and more pretentious gathering-places of the cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conwell himself is amused to remember that he wanted to talk in public
      from his boyhood, and that very early he began to yield to the inborn
      impulse. He laughs as he remembers the variety of country fairs and school
      commencements and anniversaries and even sewing-circles where he tried his
      youthful powers, and all for experience alone, in the first few years,
      except possibly for such a thing as a ham or a jack-knife! The first money
      that he ever received for speaking was, so he remembers with glee,
      seventy-five cents; and even that was not for his talk, but for horse
      hire! But at the same time there is more than amusement in recalling these
      experiences, for he knows that they were invaluable to him as training.
      And for over half a century he has affectionately remembered John B.
      Gough, who, in the height of his own power and success, saw resolution and
      possibilities in the ardent young hill-man, and actually did him the
      kindness and the honor of introducing him to an audience in one of the
      Massachusetts towns; and it was really a great kindness and a great honor,
      from a man who had won his fame to a young man just beginning an
      oratorical career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conwell&rsquo;s lecturing has been, considering everything, the most important
      work of his life, for by it he has come into close touch with so many
      millions&mdash;literally millions!&mdash;of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him once if he had any idea how many he had talked to in the
      course of his career, and he tried to estimate how many thousands of times
      he had lectured, and the average attendance for each, but desisted when he
      saw that it ran into millions of hearers. What a marvel is such a fact as
      that! Millions of hearers!
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked the same question of his private secretary, and found that no one
      had ever kept any sort of record; but as careful an estimate as could be
      made gave a conservative result of fully eight million hearers for his
      lectures; and adding the number to whom he has preached, who have been
      over five million, there is a total of well over thirteen million who have
      listened to Russell Conwell&rsquo;s voice! And this staggering total is, if
      anything, an underestimate. The figuring was done cautiously and was based
      upon such facts as that he now addresses an average of over forty-five
      hundred at his Sunday services (an average that would be higher were it
      not that his sermons in vacation time are usually delivered in little
      churches; when at home, at the Temple, he addresses three meetings every
      Sunday), and that he lectures throughout the entire course of each year,
      including six nights a week of lecturing during vacation-time. What a
      power is wielded by a man who has held over thirteen million people under
      the spell of his voice! Probably no other man who ever lived had such a
      total of hearers. And the total is steadily mounting, for he is a man who
      has never known the meaning of rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it almost certain that Dr. Conwell has never spoken to any one of
      what, to me, is the finest point of his lecture-work, and that is that he
      still goes gladly and for small fees to the small towns that are never
      visited by other men of great reputation. He knows that it is the little
      places, the out-of-the-way places, the submerged places, that most need a
      pleasure and a stimulus, and he still goes out, man of well over seventy
      that he is, to tiny towns in distant states, heedless of the discomforts
      of traveling, of the poor little hotels that seldom have visitors, of the
      oftentimes hopeless cooking and the uncleanliness, of the hardships and
      the discomforts, of the unventilated and overheated or underheated halls.
      He does not think of claiming the relaxation earned by a lifetime of
      labor, or, if he ever does, the thought of the sword of John Ring restores
      instantly his fervid earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      How he does it, how he can possibly keep it up, is the greatest marvel of
      all. I have before me a list of his engagements for the summer weeks of
      this year, 1915, and I shall set it down because it will specifically
      show, far more clearly than general statements, the kind of work he does.
      The list is the itinerary of his vacation. Vacation! Lecturing every
      evening but Sunday, and on Sundays preaching in the town where he happens
      to be!

    <p>
      And all these hardships, all this traveling and lecturing, which would
      test the endurance of the youngest and strongest, this man of over seventy
      assumes without receiving a particle of personal gain, for every dollar
      that he makes by it is given away in helping those who need helping.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Dr. Conwell is intensely modest is one of the curious features of his
      character. He sincerely believes that to write his life would be, in the
      main, just to tell what people have done for him. He knows and admits that
      he works unweariedly, but in profound sincerity he ascribes the success of
      his plans to those who have seconded and assisted him. It is in just this
      way that he looks upon every phase of his life. When he is reminded of the
      devotion of his old soldiers, he remembers it only with a sort of pleased
      wonder that they gave the devotion to him, and he quite forgets that they
      loved him because he was always ready to sacrifice ease or risk his own
      life for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He deprecates praise; if any one likes him, the liking need not be shown
      in words, but in helping along a good work. That his church has succeeded
      has been because of the devotion of the people; that the university has
      succeeded is because of the splendid work of the teachers and pupils; that
      the hospitals have done so much has been because of the noble services of
      physicians and nurses. To him, as he himself expresses it, realizing that
      success has come to his plans, it seems as if the realities are but
      dreams. He is astonished by his own success. He thinks mainly of his own
      shortcomings. &ldquo;God and man have ever been very patient with me.&rdquo; His
      depression is at times profound when he compares the actual results with
      what he would like them to be, for always his hopes have gone soaring far
      in advance of achievement. It is the &ldquo;Hitch your chariot to a star" idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      His modesty goes hand-in-hand with kindliness, and I have seen him let
      himself be introduced in his own church to his congregation, when he is
      going to deliver a lecture there, just because a former pupil of the
      university was present who, Conwell knew, was ambitious to say something
      inside of the Temple walls, and this seemed to be the only opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have noticed, when he travels, that the face of the newsboy brightens as
      he buys a paper from him, that the porter is all happiness, that conductor
      and brakeman are devotedly anxious to be of aid. Everywhere the man wins
      love. He loves humanity and humanity responds to the love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has always won the affection of those who knew him, and Bayard Taylor
      was one of the many; he and Bayard Taylor loved each other for long
      acquaintance and fellow experiences as world-wide travelers, back in the
      years when comparatively few Americans visited the Nile and the Orient, or
      even Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Taylor died there was a memorial service in Boston at which Conwell
      was asked to preside, and, as he wished for something more than addresses,
      he went to Longfellow and asked him to write and read a poem for the
      occasion. Longfellow had not thought of writing anything, and he was too
      ill to be present at the services, but, there always being something
      contagiously inspiring about Russell Conwell when he wishes something to
      be done, the poet promised to do what he could. And he wrote and sent the
      beautiful lines beginning:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>Dead he lay among his books,
   The peace of God was in his looks</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Many men of letters, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, were present at the
      services, and Dr. Conwell induced Oliver Wendell Holmes to read the lines,
      and they were listened to amid profound silence, to their fine ending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conwell, in spite of his widespread hold on millions of people, has never
      won fame, recognition, general renown, compared with many men of minor
      achievements. This seems like an impossibility. Yet it is not an
      impossibility, but a fact. Great numbers of men of education and culture
      are entirely ignorant of him and his work in the world&mdash;men, these,
      who deem themselves in touch with world-affairs and with the ones who make
      and move the world. It is inexplicable, this, except that never was there
      a man more devoid of the faculty of self-exploitation, self-advertising,
      than Russell Conwell. Nor, in the mere reading of them, do his words
      appeal with anything like the force of the same words uttered by himself,
      for always, with his spoken words, is his personality. Those who have
      heard Russell Conwell, or have known him personally, recognize the charm
      of the man and his immense forcefulness; but there are many, and among
      them those who control publicity through books and newspapers, who, though
      they ought to be the warmest in their enthusiasm, have never felt drawn to
      hear him, and, if they know of him at all, think of him as one who pleases
      in a simple way the commoner folk, forgetting in their pride that every
      really great man pleases the common ones, and that simplicity and
      directness are attributes of real greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Russell Conwell has always won the admiration of the really great, as
      well as of the humbler millions. It is only a supposedly cultured class in
      between that is not thoroughly acquainted with what he has done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, too, this is owing to his having cast in his lot with the city,
      of all cities, which, consciously or unconsciously, looks most closely to
      family and place of residence as criterions of merit&mdash;a city with
      which it is almost impossible for a stranger to become affiliated&mdash;or
      aphiladelphiated, as it might be expressed&mdash;and Philadelphia, in
      spite of all that Dr. Conwell has done, has been under the thrall of the
      fact that he went north of Market Street&mdash;that fatal fact understood
      by all who know Philadelphia&mdash;and that he made no effort to make
      friends in Rittenhouse Square. Such considerations seem absurd in this
      twentieth century, but in Philadelphia they are still potent. Tens of
      thousands of Philadelphians love him, and he is honored by its greatest
      men, but there is a class of the pseudo-cultured who do not know him or
      appreciate him. And it needs also to be understood that, outside of his
      own beloved Temple, he would prefer to go to a little church or a little
      hall and to speak to the forgotten people, in the hope of encouraging and
      inspiring them and filling them with hopeful glow, rather than to speak to
      the rich and comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dearest hope, so one of the few who are close to him told me, is that
      no one shall come into his life without being benefited. He does not say
      this publicly, nor does he for a moment believe that such a hope could be
      fully realized, but it is very dear to his heart; and no man spurred by
      such a hope, and thus bending all his thoughts toward the poor, the
      hard-working, the unsuccessful, is in a way to win honor from the Scribes;
      for we have Scribes now quite as much as when they were classed with
      Pharisees. It is not the first time in the world&rsquo;s history that Scribes
      have failed to give their recognition to one whose work was not among the
      great and wealthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Conwell himself has seldom taken any part whatever in politics except
      as a good citizen standing for good government; that, as he expresses it,
      he never held any political office except that he was once on a school
      committee, and also that he does not identify himself with the so-called
      &ldquo;movements&rdquo; that from time to time catch public attention, but aims only
      and constantly at the quiet betterment of mankind, may be mentioned as
      additional reasons why his name and fame have not been steadily blazoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knows and will admit that he works hard and has all his life worked
      hard. &ldquo;Things keep turning my way because I&rsquo;m on the job,&rdquo; as he
      whimsically expressed it one day; but that is about all, so it seems to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he sincerely believes that his life has in itself been without
      interest; that it has been an essentially commonplace life with nothing of
      the interesting or the eventful to tell. He is frankly surprised that
      there has ever been the desire to write about him. He really has no idea
      of how fascinating are the things he has done. His entire life has been of
      positive interest from the variety of things accomplished and the
      unexpectedness with which he has accomplished them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never, for example, was there such an organizer. In fact, organization and
      leadership have always been as the breath of life to him. As a youth he
      organized debating societies and, before the war, a local military
      company. While on garrison duty in the Civil War he organized what is
      believed to have been the first free school for colored children in the
      South. One day Minneapolis happened to be spoken of, and Conwell happened
      to remember that he organized, when he was a lawyer in that city, what
      became the first Y.M.C.A. branch there. Once he even started a newspaper.
      And it was natural that the organizing instinct, as years advanced, should
      lead him to greater and greater things, such as his church, with the
      numerous associations formed within itself through his influence, and the
      university&mdash;the organizing of the university being in itself an
      achievement of positive romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A life without interest!&rdquo; Why, when I happened to ask, one day, how many
      Presidents he had known since Lincoln, he replied, quite casually, that he
      had &ldquo;written the lives of most of them in their own homes&rdquo;; and by this he
      meant either personally or in collaboration with the American biographer
      Abbott.
    </p>
    <p>
      The many-sidedness of Conwell is one of the things that is always
      fascinating. After you have quite got the feeling that he is peculiarly a
      man of to-day, lecturing on to-day&rsquo;s possibilities to the people of
      to-day, you happen upon some such fact as that he attracted the attention
      of the London <i>Times</i> through a lecture on Italian history at
      Cambridge in England; or that on the evening of the day on which he was
      admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of the United States he gave a
      lecture in Washington on &ldquo;The Curriculum of the Prophets in Ancient
      Israel.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s life is a succession of delightful surprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd trait of his character is his love for fire. He could easily have
      been a veritable fire-worshiper instead of an orthodox Christian! He has
      always loved a blaze, and he says reminiscently that for no single thing
      was he punished so much when he was a child as for building bonfires. And
      after securing possession, as he did in middle age, of the house where he
      was born and of a great acreage around about, he had one of the most
      enjoyable times of his life in tearing down old buildings that needed to
      be destroyed and in heaping up fallen trees and rubbish and in piling
      great heaps of wood and setting the great piles ablaze. You see, there is
      one of the secrets of his strength&mdash;he has never lost the capacity
      for fiery enthusiasm!
    </p>
    <p>
      Always, too, in these later years he is showing his strength and
      enthusiasm in a positively noble way. He has for years been a keen
      sufferer from rheumatism and neuritis, but he has never permitted this to
      interfere with his work or plans. He makes little of his sufferings, and
      when he slowly makes his way, bent and twisted, downstairs, he does not
      want to be noticed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he will say if any one offers to
      help, and at such a time comes his nearest approach to impatience. He
      wants his suffering ignored. Strength has always been to him so precious a
      belonging that he will not relinquish it while he lives. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right!&rdquo;
       And he makes himself believe that he is all right even though the pain
      becomes so severe as to demand massage. And he will still, even when
      suffering, talk calmly, or write his letters, or attend to whatever
      matters come before him. It is the Spartan boy hiding the pain of the
      gnawing fox. And he never has let pain interfere with his presence on the
      pulpit or the platform. He has once in a while gone to a meeting on
      crutches and then, by the force of will, and inspired by what he is to do,
      has stood before his audience or congregation, a man full of strength and
      fire and life.

    <h2>
      VII. HOW A UNIVERSITY WAS FOUNDED
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE story of the foundation and rise of Temple University is an
      extraordinary story; it is not only extraordinary, but inspiring; it is
      not only inspiring, but full of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the university came out of nothing!&mdash;nothing but the need of a
      young man and the fact that he told the need to one who, throughout his
      life, has felt the impulse to help any one in need and has always obeyed
      the impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked Dr. Conwell, up at his home in the Berkshires, to tell me himself
      just how the university began, and he said that it began because it was
      needed and succeeded because of the loyal work of the teachers. And when I
      asked for details he was silent for a while, looking off into the brooding
      twilight as it lay over the waters and the trees and the hills, and then
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all so simple; it all came about so naturally. One evening, after
      a service, a young man of the congregation came to me and I saw that he
      was disturbed about something. I had him sit down by me, and I knew that
      in a few moments he would tell me what was troubling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dr. Conwell,&rsquo; he said, abruptly, &lsquo;I earn but little money, and I see no
      immediate chance of earning more. I have to support not only myself, but
      my mother. It leaves nothing at all. Yet my longing is to be a minister.
      It is the one ambition of my life. Is there anything that I can do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Any man,&rsquo; I said to him, &lsquo;with the proper determination and ambition can
      study sufficiently at night to win his desire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have tried to think so,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but I have not been able to see
      anything clearly. I want to study, and am ready to give every spare minute
      to it, but I don&rsquo;t know how to get at it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought a few minutes, as I looked at him. He was strong in his desire
      and in his ambition to fulfil it&mdash;strong enough, physically and
      mentally, for work of the body and of the mind&mdash;and he needed
      something more than generalizations of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come to me one evening a week and I will begin teaching you myself,&rsquo; I
      said, &lsquo;and at least you will in that way make a beginning&rsquo;; and I named
      the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His face brightened and he eagerly said that he would come, and left me;
      but in a little while he came hurrying back again. &lsquo;May I bring a friend
      with me?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him to bring as many as he wanted to, for more than one would be
      an advantage, and when the evening came there were six friends with him.
      And that first evening I began to teach them the foundations of Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped as if the story was over. He was looking out thoughtfully into
      the waning light, and I knew that his mind was busy with those days of the
      beginning of the institution he so loves, and whose continued success
      means so much to him. In a little while he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the beginning of it, and there is little more to tell. By the
      third evening the number of pupils had increased to forty; others joined
      in helping me, and a room was hired; then a little house, then a second
      house. From a few students and teachers we became a college. After a while
      our buildings went up on Broad Street alongside the Temple Church, and
      after another while we became a university. From the first our aim&rdquo;&mdash;(I
      noticed how quickly it had become &ldquo;our&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;my&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;our aim
      was to give education to those who were unable to get it through the usual
      channels. And so that was really all there was to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was typical of Russell Conwell&mdash;to tell with brevity of what he
      has done, to point out the beginnings of something, and quite omit to
      elaborate as to the results. And that, when you come to know him, is
      precisely what he means you to understand&mdash;that it is the beginning
      of anything that is important, and that if a thing is but earnestly begun
      and set going in the right way it may just as easily develop big results
      as little results.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his story was very far indeed from being &ldquo;all there was to it,&rdquo; for he
      had quite omitted to state the extraordinary fact that, beginning with
      those seven pupils, coming to his library on an evening in 1884, the
      Temple University has numbered, up to Commencement-time in 1915, 88,821
      students! Nearly one hundred thousand students, and in the lifetime of the
      founder! Really, the magnitude of such a work cannot be exaggerated, nor
      the vast importance of it when it is considered that most of these
      eighty-eight thousand students would not have received their education had
      it not been for Temple University. And it all came from the instant
      response of Russell Conwell to the immediate need presented by a young man
      without money!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is something else I want to say,&rdquo; said Dr. Conwell,
      unexpectedly. &ldquo;I want to say, more fully than a mere casual word, how
      nobly the work was taken up by volunteer helpers; professors from the
      University of Pennsylvania and teachers from the public schools and other
      local institutions gave freely of what time they could until the new
      venture was firmly on its way. I honor those who came so devotedly to
      help. And it should be remembered that in those early days the need was
      even greater than it would now appear, for there were then no night
      schools or manual-training schools. Since then the city of Philadelphia
      has gone into such work, and as fast as it has taken up certain branches
      the Temple University has put its energy into the branches just higher.
      And there seems no lessening of the need of it,&rdquo; he added, ponderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; there is certainly no lessening of the need of it! The figures of the
      annual catalogue would alone show that.
    </p>
    <p>
      As early as 1887, just three years after the beginning, the Temple
      College, as it was by that time called, issued its first catalogue, which
      set forth with stirring words that the intent of its founding was to:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provide such instruction as shall be best adapted to the higher education
      of those who are compelled to labor at their trade while engaged in study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cultivate a taste for the higher and most useful branches of learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awaken in the character of young laboring men and women a determined
      ambition to be useful to their fellow-men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The college&mdash;the university as it in time came to be&mdash;early
      broadened its scope, but it has from the first continued to aim at the
      needs of those unable to secure education without such help as, through
      its methods, it affords.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was chartered in 1888, at which time its numbers had reached almost six
      hundred, and it has ever since had a constant flood of applicants. &ldquo;It has
      demonstrated,&rdquo; as Dr. Conwell puts it, &ldquo;that those who work for a living
      have time for study.&rdquo; And he, though he does not himself add this, has
      given the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He feels especial pride in the features by which lectures and recitations
      are held at practically any hour which best suits the convenience of the
      students. If any ten students join in a request for any hour from nine in
      the morning to ten at night a class is arranged for them, to meet that
      request! This involves the necessity for a much larger number of
      professors and teachers than would otherwise be necessary, but that is
      deemed a slight consideration in comparison with the immense good done by
      meeting the needs of workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also President Conwell&mdash;for of course he is the president of the
      university&mdash;is proud of the fact that the privilege of graduation
      depends entirely upon knowledge gained; that graduation does not depend
      upon having listened to any set number of lectures or upon having attended
      for so many terms or years. If a student can do four years&rsquo; work in two
      years or in three he is encouraged to do it, and if he cannot even do it
      in four he can have no diploma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, there is no place at Temple University for students who care
      only for a few years of leisured ease. It is a place for workers, and not
      at all for those who merely wish to be able to boast that they attended a
      university. The students have come largely from among railroad clerks,
      bank clerks, bookkeepers, teachers, preachers, mechanics, salesmen, drug
      clerks, city and United States government employees, widows, nurses,
      housekeepers, brakemen, firemen, engineers, motormen, conductors, and shop
      hands.

      It was when the college became strong enough, and sufficiently advanced in
      scholarship and standing, and broad enough in scope, to win the name of
      university that this title was officially granted to it by the State of
      Pennsylvania, in 1907, and now its educational plan includes three
      distinct school systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      First: it offers a high-school education to the student who has to quit
      school after leaving the grammar-school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second: it offers a full college education, with the branches taught in
      long-established high-grade colleges, to the student who has to quit on
      leaving the high-school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third: it offers further scientific or professional education to the
      college graduate who must go to work immediately on quitting college, but
      who wishes to take up some such course as law or medicine or engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of last year&rsquo;s enrolment of 3,654 it is interesting to notice that the
      law claimed 141; theology, 182; medicine and pharmacy and dentistry
      combined, 357; civil engineering, 37; also that the teachers&rsquo; college,
      with normal courses on such subjects as household arts and science,
      kindergarten work, and physical education, took 174; and still more
      interesting, in a way, to see that 269 students were enrolled for the
      technical and vocational courses, such as cooking and dress-making,
      millinery, manual crafts, school-gardening, and story-telling. There were
      511 in high-school work, and 243 in elementary education. There were 79
      studying music, and 68 studying to be trained nurses. There were 606 in
      the college of liberal arts and sciences, and in the department of
      commercial education there were 987&mdash;for it is a university that
      offers both scholarship and practicality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple University is not in the least a charitable institution. Its fees
      are low, and its hours are for the convenience of the students themselves,
      but it is a place of absolute independence. It is, indeed, a place of far
      greater independence, so one of the professors pointed out, than are the
      great universities which receive millions and millions of money in private
      gifts and endowments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temple University in its early years was sorely in need of money, and
      often there were thrills of expectancy when some man of mighty wealth
      seemed on the point of giving. But not a single one ever did, and now the
      Temple likes to feel that it is glad of it. The Temple, to quote its own
      words, is &ldquo;An institution for strong men and women who can labor with both
      mind and body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the management is proud to be able to say that, although great numbers
      have come from distant places, &ldquo;not one of the many thousands ever failed
      to find an opportunity to support himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even in the early days, when money was needed for the necessary buildings
      (the buildings of which Conwell dreamed when he left second-story doors in
      his church!), the university&mdash;college it was then called&mdash;had
      won devotion from those who knew that it was a place where neither time
      nor money was wasted, and where idleness was a crime, and in the donations
      for the work were many such items as four hundred dollars from
      factory-workers who gave fifty cents each, and two thousand dollars from
      policemen who gave a dollar each. Within two or three years past the State
      of Pennsylvania has begun giving it a large sum annually, and this state
      aid is public recognition of Temple University as an institution of high
      public value. The state money is invested in the brains and hearts of the
      ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      So eager is Dr. Conwell to place the opportunity of education before every
      one, that even his servants must go to school! He is not one of those who
      can see needs that are far away but not those that are right at home. His
      belief in education, and in the highest attainable education, is profound,
      and it is not only on account of the abstract pleasure and value of
      education, but its power of increasing actual earning power and thus
      making a worker of more value to both himself and the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a man and many a woman, while continuing to work for some firm or
      factory, has taken Temple technical courses and thus fitted himself or
      herself for an advanced position with the same employer. The Temple knows
      of many such, who have thus won prominent advancement. And it knows of
      teachers who, while continuing to teach, have fitted themselves through
      the Temple courses for professorships. And it knows of many a case of the
      rise of a Temple student that reads like an Arabian Nights&rsquo; fancy!&mdash;of
      advance from bookkeeper to editor, from office-boy to bank president, from
      kitchen maid to school principal, from street-cleaner to mayor! The Temple
      University helps them that help themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Conwell told me personally of one case that especially
      interested him because it seemed to exhibit, in especial degree, the
      Temple possibilities; and it particularly interested me because it also
      showed, in high degree, the methods and personality of Dr. Conwell
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a young woman came to him and said she earned only three dollars a
      week and that she desired very much to make more. &ldquo;Can you tell me how to
      do it?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked her ambition and her directness, but there was something that he
      felt doubtful about, and that was that her hat looked too expensive for
      three dollars a week!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Dr. Conwell is a man whom you would never suspect of giving a thought
      to the hat of man or woman! But as a matter of fact there is very little
      that he does not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though the hat seemed too expensive for three dollars a week, Dr.
      Conwell is not a man who makes snap-judgments harshly, and in particular
      he would be the last man to turn away hastily one who had sought him out
      for help. He never felt, nor could possibly urge upon any one, contentment
      with a humble lot; he stands for advancement; he has no sympathy with that
      dictum of the smug, that has come to us from a nation tight bound for
      centuries by its gentry and aristocracy, about being contented with the
      position in which God has placed you, for he points out that the Bible
      itself holds up advancement and success as things desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as to the young woman before him, it developed, through discreet
      inquiry veiled by frank discussion of her case, that she had made the
      expensive-looking hat herself! Whereupon not only did all doubtfulness and
      hesitation vanish, but he saw at once how she could better herself. He
      knew that a woman who could make a hat like that for herself could make
      hats for other people, and so, &ldquo;Go into millinery as a business,&rdquo; he
      advised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;if I only could!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;But I know that I don&rsquo;t know
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the millinery course in Temple University,&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not even heard of such a course, and when he went on to explain
      how she could take it and at the same time continue at her present work
      until the course was concluded, she was positively ecstatic&mdash;it was
      all so unexpected, this opening of the view of a new and broader life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was an unusual woman,&rdquo; concluded Dr. Conwell, &ldquo;and she worked with
      enthusiasm and tirelessness. She graduated, went to an up-state city that
      seemed to offer a good field, opened a millinery establishment there, with
      her own name above the door, and became prosperous. That was only a few
      years ago. And recently I had a letter from her, telling me that last year
      she netted a clear profit of three thousand six hundred dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remember a man, himself of distinguished position, saying of Dr.
      Conwell, &ldquo;It is difficult to speak in tempered language of what he has
      achieved.&rdquo; And that just expresses it; the temptation is constantly to use
      superlatives&mdash;for superlatives fit! Of course he has succeeded for
      himself, and succeeded marvelously, in his rise from the rocky hill farm,
      but he has done so vastly more than that in inspiring such hosts of others
      to succeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      A dreamer of dreams and a seer of visions&mdash;and what realizations have
      come! And it interested me profoundly not long ago, when Dr. Conwell,
      talking of the university, unexpectedly remarked that he would like to see
      such institutions scattered throughout every state in the Union. &ldquo;All
      carried on at slight expense to the students and at hours to suit all
      sorts of working men and women,&rdquo; he added, after a pause; and then,
      abruptly, &ldquo;I should like to see the possibility of higher education
      offered to every one in the United States who works for a living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something superb in the very imagining of such a nation-wide
      system. But I did not ask whether or not he had planned any details for
      such an effort. I knew that thus far it might only be one of his dreams&mdash;but
      I also knew that his dreams had a way of becoming realities. I had a
      fleeting glimpse of his soaring vision. It was amazing to find a man of
      more than three-score and ten thus dreaming of more worlds to conquer. And
      I thought, what could the world have accomplished if Methuselah had been a
      Conwell!&mdash;or, far better, what wonders could be accomplished if
      Conwell could but be a Methuselah!
    </p>
    <p>
      He has all his life been a great traveler. He is a man who sees vividly
      and who can describe vividly. Yet often his letters, even from places of
      the most profound interest, are mostly concerned with affairs back home.
      It is not that he does not feel, and feel intensely, the interest of what
      he is visiting, but that his tremendous earnestness keeps him always
      concerned about his work at home. There could be no stronger example than
      what I noticed in a letter he wrote from Jerusalem. &ldquo;I am in Jerusalem!
      And here at Gethsemane and at the Tomb of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;reading thus far,
      one expects that any man, and especially a minister, is sure to say
      something regarding the associations of the place and the effect of these
      associations on his mind; but Conwell is always the man who is different&mdash;&ldquo;And
      here at Gethsemane and at the Tomb of Christ, I pray especially for the
      Temple University.&rdquo; That is Conwellism!
    </p>
    <p>
      That he founded a hospital&mdash;a work in itself great enough for even a
      great life is but one among the striking incidents of his career. And it
      came about through perfect naturalness. For he came to know, through his
      pastoral work and through his growing acquaintance with the needs of the
      city, that there was a vast amount of suffering and wretchedness and
      anguish, because of the inability of the existing hospitals to care for
      all who needed care. There was so much sickness and suffering to be
      alleviated, there were so many deaths that could be prevented&mdash;and so
      he decided to start another hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, like everything with him, the beginning was small. That cannot too
      strongly be set down as the way of this phenomenally successful organizer.
      Most men would have to wait until a big beginning could be made, and so
      would most likely never make a beginning at all. But Conwell&rsquo;s way is to
      dream of future bigness, but be ready to begin at once, no matter how
      small or insignificant the beginning may appear to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two rented rooms, one nurse, one patient&mdash;this was the humble
      beginning, in 1891, of what has developed into the great Samaritan
      Hospital. In a year there was an entire house, fitted up with wards and
      operating-room. Now it occupies several buildings, including and adjoining
      that first one, and a great new structure is planned. But even as it is,
      it has a hundred and seventy beds, is fitted with all modern hospital
      appliances, and has a large staff of physicians; and the number of
      surgical operations performed there is very large.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is open to sufferers of any race or creed, and the poor are never
      refused admission, the rule being that treatment is free for those who
      cannot pay, but that such as can afford it shall pay according to their
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the hospital has a kindly feature that endears it to patients and
      their relatives alike, and that is that, by Dr. Conwell&rsquo;s personal order,
      there are not only the usual week-day hours for visiting, but also one
      evening a week and every Sunday afternoon. &ldquo;For otherwise,&rdquo; as he says,
      &ldquo;many would be unable to come because they could not get away from their
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little over eight years ago another hospital was taken in charge, the
      Garretson&mdash;not founded by Conwell, this one, but acquired, and
      promptly expanded in its usefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the Samaritan and the Garretson are part of Temple University. The
      Samaritan Hospital has treated, since its foundation, up to the middle of
      1915, 29,301 patients; the Garretson, in its shorter life, 5,923.
      Including dispensary cases as well as house patients, the two hospitals
      together, under the headship of President Conwell, have handled over
      400,000 cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Conwell can possibly meet the multifarious demands upon his time is in
      itself a miracle. He is the head of the great church; he is the head of
      the university; he is the head of the hospitals; he is the head of
      everything with which he is associated! And he is not only nominally, but
      very actively, the head!

    <h2>
      VIII. HIS SPLENDID EFFICIENCY
    </h2>
    <p>
      CONWELL has a few strong and efficient executive helpers who have long
      been associated with him; men and women who know his ideas and ideals, who
      are devoted to him, and who do their utmost to relieve him; and of course
      there is very much that is thus done for him; but even as it is, he is so
      overshadowing a man (there is really no other word) that all who work with
      him look to him for advice and guidance the professors and the students,
      the doctors and the nurses, the church officers, the Sunday-school
      teachers, the members of his congregation. And he is never too busy to see
      any one who really wishes to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He can attend to a vast intricacy of detail, and answer myriad personal
      questions and doubts, and keep the great institutions splendidly going, by
      thorough systematization of time, and by watching every minute. He has
      several secretaries, for special work, besides his private secretary. His
      correspondence is very great. Often he dictates to a secretary as he
      travels on the train. Even in the few days for which he can run back to
      the Berkshires, work is awaiting him. Work follows him. And after knowing
      of this, one is positively amazed that he is able to give to his
      country-wide lectures the time and the traveling that they inexorably
      demand. Only a man of immense strength, of the greatest stamina, a
      veritable superman, could possibly do it. And at times one quite forgets,
      noticing the multiplicity of his occupations, that he prepares two sermons
      and two talks on Sunday!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is his usual Sunday schedule, when at home. He rises at seven and
      studies until breakfast, which is at eight-thirty. Then he studies until
      nine-forty-five, when he leads a men&rsquo;s meeting at which he is likely also
      to play the organ and lead the singing. At ten-thirty is the principal
      church service, at which he preaches, and at the close of which he shakes
      hands with hundreds. He dines at one, after which he takes fifteen
      minutes&rsquo; rest and then reads; and at three o&rsquo;clock he addresses, in a talk
      that is like another sermon, a large class of men&mdash;not the same men
      as in the morning. He is also sure to look in at the regular session of
      the Sunday-school. Home again, where he studies and reads until
      supper-time. At seven-thirty is the evening service, at which he again
      preaches and after which he shakes hands with several hundred more and
      talks personally, in his study, with any who have need of talk with him.
      He is usually home by ten-thirty. I spoke of it, one evening, as having
      been a strenuous day, and he responded, with a cheerfully whimsical smile:
      &ldquo;Three sermons and shook hands with nine hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, as the service closed, he had said to the congregation: &ldquo;I
      shall be here for an hour. We always have a pleasant time together after
      service. If you are acquainted with me, come up and shake hands. If you
      are strangers&rdquo;&mdash;just the slightest of pauses&mdash;&ldquo;come up and let
      us make an acquaintance that will last for eternity.&rdquo; I remember how
      simply and easily this was said, in his clear, deep voice, and how
      impressive and important it seemed, and with what unexpectedness it came.
      &ldquo;Come and make an acquaintance that will last for eternity!&rdquo; And there was
      a serenity about his way of saying this which would make strangers think&mdash;just
      as he meant them to think&mdash;that he had nothing whatever to do but to
      talk with them. Even his own congregation have, most of them, little
      conception of how busy a man he is and how precious is his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening last June to take an evening of which I happened to know&mdash;he
      got home from a journey of two hundred miles at six o&rsquo;clock, and after
      dinner and a slight rest went to the church prayer-meeting, which he led
      in his usual vigorous way at such meetings, playing the organ and leading
      the singing, as well as praying and talk-ing. After the prayer-meeting he
      went to two dinners in succession, both of them important dinners in
      connection with the close of the university year, and at both dinners he
      spoke. At the second dinner he was notified of the sudden illness of a
      member of his congregation, and instantly hurried to the man&rsquo;s home and
      thence to the hospital to which he had been removed, and there he remained
      at the man&rsquo;s bedside, or in consultation with the physicians, until one in
      the morning. Next morning he was up at seven and again at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one thing I do,&rdquo; is his private maxim of efficiency, and a
      literalist might point out that he does not one thing only, but a thousand
      things, not getting Conwell&rsquo;s meaning, which is that whatever the thing
      may be which he is doing he lets himself think of nothing else until it is
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Conwell has a profound love for the country and particularly for the
      country of his own youth. He loves the wind that comes sweeping over the
      hills, he loves the wide-stretching views from the heights and the forest
      intimacies of the nestled nooks. He loves the rippling streams, he loves
      the wild flowers that nestle in seclusion or that unexpectedly paint some
      mountain meadow with delight. He loves the very touch of the earth, and he
      loves the great bare rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He writes verses at times; at least he has written lines for a few old
      tunes; and it interested me greatly to chance upon some lines of his that
      picture heaven in terms of the Berkshires:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>The wide-stretching valleys in colors so fadeless,
   Where trees are all deathless and flowers e&rsquo;er bloom</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      That is heaven in the eyes of a New England hill-man! Not golden pavement
      and ivory palaces, but valleys and trees and flowers and the wide sweep of
      the open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few things please him more than to go, for example, blackberrying, and he
      has a knack of never scratching his face or his fingers when doing so. And
      he finds blackberrying, whether he goes alone or with friends, an
      extraordinarily good time for planning something he wishes to do or
      working out the thought of a sermon. And fishing is even better, for in
      fishing he finds immense recreation and restfulness and at the same time a
      further opportunity to think and plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a small boy he wished that he could throw a dam across the trout-brook
      that runs near the little Conwell home, and&mdash;as he never gives up&mdash;he
      finally realized the ambition, although it was after half a century! And
      now he has a big pond, three-quarters of a mile long by half a mile wide,
      lying in front of the house, down a slope from it&mdash;a pond stocked
      with splendid pickerel. He likes to float about restfully on this pond,
      thinking or fishing, or both. And on that pond he showed me how to catch
      pickerel even under a blaze of sunlight!
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a trout-fisher, too, for it is a trout stream that feeds this pond
      and goes dashing away from it through the wilderness; and for miles
      adjoining his place a fishing club of wealthy men bought up the rights in
      this trout stream, and they approached him with a liberal offer. But he
      declined it. &ldquo;I remembered what good times I had when I was a boy, fishing
      up and down that stream, and I couldn&rsquo;t think of keeping the boys of the
      present day from such a pleasure. So they may still come and fish for
      trout here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we walked one day beside this brook, he suddenly said: &ldquo;Did you ever
      notice that every brook has its own song? I should know the song of this
      brook anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would seem as if he loved his rugged native country because it is
      rugged even more than because it is native! Himself so rugged, so hardy,
      so enduring&mdash;the strength of the hills is his also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always, in his very appearance, you see something of this ruggedness of
      the hills; a ruggedness, a sincerity, a plainness, that mark alike his
      character and his looks. And always one realizes the strength of the man,
      even when his voice, as it usually is, is low. And one increasingly
      realizes the strength when, on the lecture platform or in the pulpit or in
      conversation, he flashes vividly into fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big-boned man he is, sturdy-framed, a tall man, with broad shoulders and
      strong hands. His hair is a deep chestnut-brown that at first sight seems
      black. In his early manhood he was superb in looks, as his pictures show,
      but anxiety and work and the constant flight of years, with physical pain,
      have settled his face into lines of sadness and almost of severity, which
      instantly vanish when he speaks. And his face is illumined by marvelous
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a lonely man. The wife of his early years died long, long ago,
      before success had come, and she was deeply mourned, for she had loyally
      helped him through a time that held much of struggle and hardship. He
      married again; and this wife was his loyal helpmate for many years. In a
      time of special stress, when a defalcation of sixty-five thousand dollars
      threatened to crush Temple College just when it was getting on its feet,
      for both Temple Church and Temple College had in those early days
      buoyantly assumed heavy indebtedness, he raised every dollar he could by
      selling or mortgaging his own possessions, and in this his wife, as he
      lovingly remembers, most cordially stood beside him, although she knew
      that if anything should happen to him the financial sacrifice would leave
      her penniless. She died after years of companionship; his children married
      and made homes of their own; he is a lonely man. Yet he is not unhappy,
      for the tremendous demands of his tremendous work leave him little time
      for sadness or retrospect. At times the realization comes that he is
      getting old, that friends and comrades have been passing away, leaving him
      an old man with younger friends and helpers. But such realization only
      makes him work with an earnestness still more intense, knowing that the
      night cometh when no man shall work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeply religious though he is, he does not force religion into
      conversation on ordinary subjects or upon people who may not be interested
      in it. With him, it is action and good works, with faith and belief, that
      count, except when talk is the natural, the fitting, the necessary thing;
      when addressing either one individual or thousands, he talks with superb
      effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sermons are, it may almost literally be said, parable after parable;
      although he himself would be the last man to say this, for it would sound
      as if he claimed to model after the greatest of all examples. His own way
      of putting it is that he uses stories frequently because people are more
      impressed by illustrations than by argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always, whether in the pulpit or out of it, he is simple and homelike,
      human and unaffected. If he happens to see some one in the congregation to
      whom he wishes to speak, he may just leave his pulpit and walk down the
      aisle, while the choir is singing, and quietly say a few words and return.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early days of his ministry, if he heard of a poor family in
      immediate need of food he would be quite likely to gather a basket of
      provisions and go personally, and offer this assistance and such other as
      he might find necessary when he reached the place. As he became known he
      ceased from this direct and open method of charity, for he knew that
      impulsiveness would be taken for intentional display. But he has never
      ceased to be ready to help on the instant that he knows help is needed.
      Delay and lengthy investigation are avoided by him when he can be certain
      that something immediate is required. And the extent of his quiet charity
      is amazing. With no family for which to save money, and with no care to
      put away money for himself, he thinks only of money as an instrument for
      helpfulness. I never heard a friend criticize him except for too great
      open-handedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was strongly impressed, after coming to know him, that he possessed many
      of the qualities that made for the success of the old-time district
      leaders of New York City, and I mentioned this to him, and he at once
      responded that he had himself met &ldquo;Big Tim,&rdquo; the long-time leader of the
      Sullivans, and had had him at his house, Big Tim having gone to
      Philadelphia to aid some henchman in trouble, and having promptly sought
      the aid of Dr. Conwell. And it was characteristic of Conwell that he saw,
      what so many never saw, the most striking characteristic of that Tammany
      leader. For, &ldquo;Big Tim Sullivan was so kind-hearted!&rdquo; Conwell appreciated
      the man&rsquo;s political unscrupulousness as well as did his enemies, but he
      saw also what made his underlying power&mdash;his kind-heartedness. Except
      that Sullivan could be supremely unscrupulous, and that Conwell is
      supremely scrupulous, there were marked similarities in these masters over
      men; and Conwell possesses, as Sullivan possessed, a wonderful memory for
      faces and names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, Russell Conwell stands steadily and strongly for good
      citizenship. But he never talks boastful Americanism. He seldom speaks in
      so many words of either Americanism or good citizenship, but he constantly
      and silently keeps the American flag, as the symbol of good citizenship,
      before his people. An American flag is prominent in his church; an
      American flag is seen in his home; a beautiful American flag is up at his
      Berkshire place and surmounts a lofty tower where, when he was a boy,
      there stood a mighty tree at the top of which was an eagle&rsquo;s nest, which
      has given him a name for his home, for he terms it &ldquo;The Eagle&rsquo;s Nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Remembering a long story that I had read of his climbing to the top of
      that tree, though it was a well-nigh impossible feat, and securing the
      nest by great perseverance and daring, I asked him if the story were a
      true one. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve heard something about it; somebody said that somebody
      watched me, or something of the kind. But I don&rsquo;t remember anything about
      it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any friend of his is sure to say something, after a while, about his
      determination, his insistence on going ahead with anything on which he has
      really set his heart. One of the very important things on which he
      insisted, in spite of very great opposition, and especially an opposition
      from the other churches of his denomination (for this was a good many
      years ago, when there was much more narrowness in churches and sects than
      there is at present), was with regard to doing away with close communion.
      He determined on an open communion; and his way of putting it, once
      decided upon, was: &ldquo;My friends, it is not for me to invite you to the
      table of the Lord. The table of the Lord is open. If you feel that you can
      come to the table, it is open to you.&rdquo; And this is the form which he still
      uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He not only never gives up, but, so his friends say, he never forgets a
      thing upon which he has once decided, and at times, long after they
      supposed the matter has been entirely forgotten, they suddenly find Dr.
      Conwell bringing his original purpose to pass. When I was told of this I
      remembered that pickerel-pond in the Berkshires!
    </p>
    <p>
      If he is really set upon doing anything, little or big, adverse criticism
      does not disturb his serenity. Some years ago he began wearing a huge
      diamond, whose size attracted much criticism and caustic comment. He never
      said a word in defense; he just kept on wearing the diamond. One day,
      however, after some years, he took it off, and people said, &ldquo;He has
      listened to the criticism at last!&rdquo; He smiled reminiscently as he told me
      about this, and said: &ldquo;A dear old deacon of my congregation gave me that
      diamond and I did not like to hurt his feelings by refusing it. It really
      bothered me to wear such a glaring big thing, but because I didn&rsquo;t want to
      hurt the old deacon&rsquo;s feelings I kept on wearing it until he was dead.
      Then I stopped wearing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ambition of Russell Conwell is to continue working and working until
      the very last moment of his life. In work he forgets his sadness, his
      loneliness, his age. And he said to me one day, &ldquo;I will die in harness.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IX. THE STORY OF ACRES OF DIAMONDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      CONSIDERING everything, the most remarkable thing in Russell Conwell&rsquo;s
      remarkable life is his lecture, &ldquo;Acres of Diamonds.&rdquo; That is, the lecture
      itself, the number of times he has delivered it, what a source of
      inspiration it has been to myriads, the money that he has made and is
      making, and, still more, the purpose to which he directs the money. In the
      circumstances surrounding &ldquo;Acres of Diamonds,&rdquo; in its tremendous success,
      in the attitude of mind revealed by the lecture itself and by what Dr.
      Conwell does with it, it is illuminative of his character, his aims, his
      ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lecture is vibrant with his energy. It flashes with his hopefulness.
      It is full of his enthusiasm. It is packed full of his intensity. It
      stands for the possibilities of success in every one. He has delivered it
      over five thousand times. The demand for it never diminishes. The success
      grows never less.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a time in Russell Conwell&rsquo;s youth of which it is pain for him to
      think. He told me of it one evening, and his voice sank lower and lower as
      he went far back into the past. It was of his days at Yale that he spoke,
      for they were days of suffering. For he had not money for Yale, and in
      working for more he endured bitter humiliation. It was not that the work
      was hard, for Russell Conwell has always been ready for hard work. It was
      not that there were privations and difficulties, for he has always found
      difficulties only things to overcome, and endured privations with cheerful
      fortitude. But it was the humiliations that he met&mdash;the personal
      humiliations that after more than half a century make him suffer in
      remembering them&mdash;yet out of those humiliations came a marvelous
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I determined,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that whatever I could do to make the way easier
      at college for other young men working their way I would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, many years ago, he began to devote every dollar that he made from
      &ldquo;Acres of Diamonds&rdquo; to this definite purpose. He has what may be termed a
      waiting-list. On that list are very few cases he has looked into
      personally. Infinitely busy man that he is, he cannot do extensive
      personal investigation. A large proportion of his names come to him from
      college presidents who know of students in their own colleges in need of
      such a helping hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every night,&rdquo; he said, when I asked him to tell me about it, &ldquo;when my
      lecture is over and the check is in my hand, I sit down in my room in the
      hotel&rdquo;&mdash;what a lonely picture, tool&mdash;&ldquo;I sit down in my room in
      the hotel and subtract from the total sum received my actual expenses for
      that place, and make out a check for the difference and send it to some
      young man on my list. And I always send with the check a letter of advice
      and helpfulness, expressing my hope that it will be of some service to him
      and telling him that he is to feel under no obligation except to his Lord.
      I feel strongly, and I try to make every young man feel, that there must
      be no sense of obligation to me personally. And I tell them that I am
      hoping to leave behind me men who will do more work than I have done.
      Don&rsquo;t think that I put in too much advice,&rdquo; he added, with a smile, &ldquo;for I
      only try to let them know that a friend is trying to help them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face lighted as he spoke. &ldquo;There is such a fascination in it!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;It is just like a gamble! And as soon as I have sent the
      letter and crossed a name off my list, I am aiming for the next one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after a pause he added: &ldquo;I do not attempt to send any young man enough
      for all his expenses. But I want to save him from bitterness, and each
      check will help. And, too,&rdquo; he concluded, naïvely, in the vernacular, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t want them to lay down on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told me that he made it clear that he did not wish to get returns or
      reports from this branch of his life-work, for it would take a great deal
      of time in watching and thinking and in the reading and writing of
      letters. &ldquo;But it is mainly,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that I do not wish to hold over
      their heads the sense of obligation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I suggested that this was surely an example of bread cast upon the
      waters that could not return, he was silent for a little and then said,
      thoughtfully: &ldquo;As one gets on in years there is satisfaction in doing a
      thing for the sake of doing it. The bread returns in the sense of effort
      made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a recent trip through Minnesota he was positively upset, so his
      secretary told me, through being recognized on a train by a young man who
      had been helped through &ldquo;Acres of Diamonds,&rdquo; and who, finding that this
      was really Dr. Conwell, eagerly brought his wife to join him in most
      fervent thanks for his assistance. Both the husband and his wife were so
      emotionally overcome that it quite overcame Dr. Conwell himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lecture, to quote the noble words of Dr. Conwell himself, is designed
      to help &ldquo;every person, of either sex, who cherishes the high resolve of
      sustaining a career of usefulness and honor.&rdquo; It is a lecture of
      helpfulness. And it is a lecture, when given with Conwell&rsquo;s voice and face
      and manner, that is full of fascination. And yet it is all so simple!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is packed full of inspiration, of suggestion, of aid. He alters it to
      meet the local circumstances of the thousands of different places in which
      he delivers it. But the base remains the same. And even those to whom it
      is an old story will go to hear him time after time. It amuses him to say
      that he knows individuals who have listened to it twenty times.
    </p>
    <p>
      It begins with a story told to Conwell by an old Arab as the two journeyed
      together toward Nineveh, and, as you listen, you hear the actual voices
      and you see the sands of the desert and the waving palms. The lecturer&rsquo;s
      voice is so easy, so effortless, it seems so ordinary and matter-of-fact&mdash;yet
      the entire scene is instantly vital and alive! Instantly the man has his
      audience under a sort of spell, eager to listen, ready to be merry or
      grave. He has the faculty of control, the vital quality that makes the
      orator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same people will go to hear this lecture over and over, and that is
      the kind of tribute that Conwell likes. I recently heard him deliver it in
      his own church, where it would naturally be thought to be an old story,
      and where, presumably, only a few of the faithful would go; but it was
      quite clear that all of his church are the faithful, for it was a large
      audience that came to listen to him; hardly a seat in the great auditorium
      was vacant. And it should be added that, although it was in his own
      church, it was not a free lecture, where a throng might be expected, but
      that each one paid a liberal sum for a seat&mdash;and the paying of
      admission is always a practical test of the sincerity of desire to hear.
      And the people were swept along by the current as if lecturer and lecture
      were of novel interest. The lecture in itself is good to read, but it is
      only when it is illumined by Conwell&rsquo;s vivid personality that one
      understands how it influences in the actual delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that particular evening he had decided to give the lecture in the same
      form as when he first delivered it many years ago, without any of the
      alterations that have come with time and changing localities, and as he
      went on, with the audience rippling and bubbling with laughter as usual,
      he never doubted that he was giving it as he had given it years before;
      and yet&mdash;so up-to-date and alive must he necessarily be, in spite of
      a definitive effort to set himself back&mdash;every once in a while he was
      coming out with illustrations from such distinctly recent things as the
      automobile!
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time I heard him was the 5,124th time for the lecture. Doesn&rsquo;t it
      seem incredible! 5,124 times&rsquo; I noticed that he was to deliver it at a
      little out-of-the-way place, difficult for any considerable number to get
      to, and I wondered just how much of an audience would gather and how they
      would be impressed. So I went over from there I was, a few miles away. The
      road was dark and I pictured a small audience, but when I got there I
      found the church building in which he was to deliver the lecture had a
      seating capacity of 830 and that precisely 830 people were already seated
      there and that a fringe of others were standing behind. Many had come from
      miles away. Yet the lecture had scarcely, if at all, been advertised. But
      people had said to one another: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to hear Dr. Conwell?&rdquo;
       And the word had thus been passed along.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember how fascinating it was to watch that audience, for they
      responded so keenly and with such heartfelt pleasure throughout the entire
      lecture. And not only were they immensely pleased and amused and
      interested&mdash;and to achieve that at a crossroads church was in itself
      a triumph to be proud of&mdash;but I knew that every listener was given an
      impulse toward doing something for himself and for others, and that with
      at least some of them the impulse would materialize in acts. Over and over
      one realizes what a power such a man wields.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what an unselfishness! For, far on in years as he is, and suffering
      pain, he does not chop down his lecture to a definite length; he does not
      talk for just an hour or go on grudgingly for an hour and a half. He sees
      that the people are fascinated and inspired, and he forgets pain, ignores
      time, forgets that the night is late and that he has a long journey to go
      to get home, and keeps on generously for two hours! And every one wishes
      it were four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always he talks with ease and sympathy. There are geniality, composure,
      humor, simple and homely jests&mdash;yet never does the audience forget
      that he is every moment in tremendous earnest. They bubble with responsive
      laughter or are silent in riveted attention. A stir can be seen to sweep
      over an audience, of earnestness or surprise or amusement or resolve. When
      he is grave and sober or fervid the people feel that he is himself a
      fervidly earnest man, and when he is telling something humorous there is
      on his part almost a repressed chuckle, a genial appreciation of the fun
      of it, not in the least as if he were laughing at his own humor, but as if
      he and his hearers were laughing together at something of which they were
      all humorously cognizant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myriad successes in life have come through the direct inspiration of this
      single lecture. One hears of so many that there must be vastly more that
      are never told. A few of the most recent were told me by Dr. Conwell
      himself, one being of a farmer boy who walked a long distance to hear him.
      On his way home, so the boy, now a man, has written him, he thought over
      and over of what he could do to advance himself, and before he reached
      home he learned that a teacher was wanted at a certain country school. He
      knew he did not know enough to teach, but was sure he could learn, so he
      bravely asked for the place. And something in his earnestness made him win
      a temporary appointment. Thereupon he worked and studied so hard and so
      devotedly, while he daily taught, that within a few months he was
      regularly employed there. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; says Conwell, abruptly, with his
      characteristic skim-ming over of the intermediate details between the
      important beginning of a thing and the satisfactory end, &ldquo;and now that
      young man is one of our college presidents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And very recently a lady came to Dr. Conwell, the wife of an exceptionally
      prominent man who was earning a large salary, and she told him that her
      husband was so unselfishly generous with money that often they were almost
      in straits. And she said they had bought a little farm as a country place,
      paying only a few hundred dollars for it, and that she had said to
      herself, laughingly, after hearing the lecture, &ldquo;There are no acres of
      diamonds on this place!&rdquo; But she also went on to tell that she had found a
      spring of exceptionally fine water there, although in buying they had
      scarcely known of the spring at all; and she had been so inspired by
      Conwell that she had had the water analyzed and, finding that it was
      remarkably pure, had begun to have it bottled and sold under a trade name
      as special spring water. And she is making money. And she also sells pure
      ice from the pool, cut in winter-time and all because of &ldquo;Acres of
      Diamonds&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Several millions of dollars, in all, have been received by Russell Conwell
      as the proceeds from this single lecture. Such a fact is almost staggering&mdash;and
      it is more staggering to realize what good is done in the world by this
      man, who does not earn for himself, but uses his money in immediate
      helpfulness. And one can neither think nor write with moderation when it
      is further realized that far more good than can be done directly with
      money he does by uplifting and inspiring with this lecture. Always his
      heart is with the weary and the heavy-laden. Always he stands for
      self-betterment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year, 1914, he and his work were given unique recognition. For it was
      known by his friends that this particular lecture was approaching its
      five-thousandth delivery, and they planned a celebration of such an event
      in the history of the most popular lecture in the world. Dr. Conwell
      agreed to deliver it in the Academy of Music, in Philadelphia, and the
      building was packed and the streets outside were thronged. The proceeds
      from all sources for that five-thousandth lecture were over nine thousand
      dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hold which Russell Conwell has gained on the affections and respect of
      his home city was seen not only in the thousands who strove to hear him,
      but in the prominent men who served on the local committee in charge of
      the celebration. There was a national committee, too, and the nation-wide
      love that he has won, the nation-wide appreciation of what he has done and
      is still doing, was shown by the fact that among the names of the notables
      on this committee were those of nine governors of states. The Governor of
      Pennsylvania was himself present to do Russell Conwell honor, and he gave
      to him a key emblematic of the Freedom of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Freedom of the State&rdquo;&mdash;yes; this man, well over seventy, has won
      it. The Freedom of the State, the Freedom of the Nation&mdash;for this man
      of helpfulness, this marvelous exponent of the gospel of success, has
      worked marvelously for the freedom, the betterment, the liberation, the
      advancement, of the individual.

    <h2>
      FIFTY YEARS ON THE LECTURE PLATFORM
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Russell H. Conwell
    </h3>
    <p>
      AN Autobiography! What an absurd request! If all the conditions were
      favorable, the story of my public Life could not be made interesting. It
      does not seem possible that any will care to read so plain and uneventful
      a tale. I see nothing in it for boasting, nor much that could be helpful.
      Then I never saved a scrap of paper intentionally concerning my work to
      which I could refer, not a book, not a sermon, not a lecture, not a
      newspaper notice or account, not a magazine article, not one of the kind
      biographies written from time to time by noble friends have I ever kept
      even as a souvenir, although some of them may be in my library. I have
      ever felt that the writers concerning my life were too generous and that
      my own work was too hastily done. Hence I have nothing upon which to base
      an autobiographical account, except the recollections which come to an
      overburdened mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      My general view of half a century on the lecture platform brings to me
      precious and beautiful memories, and fills my soul with devout gratitude
      for the blessings and kindnesses which have been given to me so far beyond
      my deserts. So much more success has come to my hands than I ever
      expected; so much more of good have I found than even youth&rsquo;s wildest
      dream included; so much more effective have been my weakest endeavors than
      I ever planned or hoped&mdash;that a biography written truthfully would be
      mostly an account of what men and women have done for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have lived to see accomplished far more than my highest ambition
      included, and have seen the enterprises I have undertaken rush by me,
      pushed on by a thousand strong hands until they have left me far behind
      them. The realities are like dreams to me. Blessings on the loving hearts
      and noble minds who have been so willing to sacrifice for others&rsquo; good and
      to think only of what they could do, and never of what they should get!
      Many of them have ascended into the Shining Land, and here I am in mine
      age gazing up alone,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>Only waiting till the shadows
   Are a little longer grown</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Fifty years! I was a young man, not yet of age, when I delivered my first
      platform lecture. The Civil War of 1861-65 drew on with all its passions,
      patriotism, horrors, and fears, and I was studying law at Yale University.
      I had from childhood felt that I was &ldquo;called to the ministry.&rdquo; The
      earliest event of memory is the prayer of my father at family prayers in
      the little old cottage in the Hampshire highlands of the Berkshire Hills,
      calling on God with a sobbing voice to lead me into some special service
      for the Saviour. It filled me with awe, dread, and fear, and I recoiled
      from the thought, until I determined to fight against it with all my
      power. So I sought for other professions and for decent excuses for being
      anything but a preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet while I was nervous and timid before the class in declamation and
      dreaded to face any kind of an audience, I felt in my soul a strange
      impulsion toward public speaking which for years made me miserable. The
      war and the public meetings for recruiting soldiers furnished an outlet
      for my suppressed sense of duty, and my first lecture was on the &ldquo;Lessons
      of History&rdquo; as applied to the campaigns against the Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That matchless temperance orator and loving friend, John B. Gough,
      introduced me to the little audience in Westfield, Massachusetts, in 1862.
      What a foolish little school-boy speech it must have been! But Mr. Gough&rsquo;s
      kind words of praise, the bouquets and the applause, made me feel that
      somehow the way to public oratory would not be so hard as I had feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time I acted on Mr. Gough&rsquo;s advice and &ldquo;sought practice&rdquo; by
      accepting almost every invitation I received to speak on any kind of a
      subject. There were many sad failures and tears, but it was a restful
      compromise with my conscience concerning the ministry, and it pleased my
      friends. I addressed picnics, Sunday-schools, patriotic meetings,
      funerals, anniversaries, commencements, debates, cattle-shows, and
      sewing-circles without partiality and without price. For the first five
      years the income was all experience. Then voluntary gifts began to come
      occasionally in the shape of a jack-knife, a ham, a book, and the first
      cash remuneration was from a farmers&rsquo; club, of seventy-five cents toward
      the &ldquo;horse hire.&rdquo; It was a curious fact that one member of that club
      afterward moved to Salt Lake City and was a member of the committee at the
      Mormon Tabernacle in 1872 which, when I was a correspondent, on a journey
      around the world, employed me to lecture on &ldquo;Men of the Mountains&rdquo; in the
      Mormon Tabernacle, at a fee of five hundred dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was gaining practice in the first years of platform work, I had
      the good fortune to have profitable employment as a soldier, or as a
      correspondent or lawyer, or as an editor or as a preacher, which enabled
      me to pay my own expenses, and it has been seldom in the fifty years that
      I have ever taken a fee for my personal use. In the last thirty-six years
      I have dedicated solemnly all the lecture income to benevolent
      enterprises. If I am antiquated enough for an autobiography, perhaps I may
      be aged enough to avoid the criticism of being an egotist, when I state
      that some years I delivered one lecture, &ldquo;Acres of Diamonds,&rdquo; over two
      hundred times each year, at an average income of about one hundred and
      fifty dollars for each lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a remarkable good fortune which came to me as a lecturer when Mr.
      James Redpath organized the first lecture bureau ever established. Mr.
      Redpath was the biographer of John Brown of Harper&rsquo;s Ferry renown, and as
      Mr. Brown had been long a friend of my father&rsquo;s I found employment, while
      a student on vacation, in selling that life of John Brown. That
      acquaintance with Mr. Redpath was maintained until Mr. Redpath&rsquo;s death. To
      General Charles H. Taylor, with whom I was employed for a time as reporter
      for the Boston <i>Daily Traveler</i>, I was indebted for many acts of
      self-sacrificing friendship which soften my soul as I recall them. He did
      me the greatest kindness when he suggested my name to Mr. Redpath as one
      who could &ldquo;fill in the vacancies in the smaller towns&rdquo; where the &ldquo;great
      lights could not always be secured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a glorious galaxy of great names that original list of Redpath
      lecturers contained! Henry Ward Beecher, John B. Gough, Senator Charles
      Sumner, Theodore Tilton, Wendell Phillips, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, Bayard
      Taylor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, with many of the great preachers, musicians,
      and writers of that remarkable era. Even Dr. Holmes, John Whittier, Henry
      W. Longfellow, John Lothrop Motley, George William Curtis, and General
      Burnside were persuaded to appear one or more times, although they refused
      to receive pay. I cannot forget how ashamed I felt when my name ap-peared
      in the shadow of such names, and how sure I was that every acquaintance
      was ridiculing me behind my back. Mr. Bayard Taylor, however, wrote me
      from the <i>Tribune</i> office a kind note saying that he was glad to see
      me &ldquo;on the road to great usefulness.&rdquo; Governor Clafflin, of Massachusetts,
      took the time to send me a note of congratulation. General Benjamin F.
      Butler, however, advised me to &ldquo;stick to the last&rdquo; and be a good lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of lecturing was always a task and a duty. I do not feel now that
      I ever sought to be an entertainer. I am sure I would have been an utter
      failure but for the feeling that I must preach some gospel truth in my
      lectures and do at least that much toward that ever-persistent &ldquo;call of
      God.&rdquo; When I entered the ministry (1879) I had become so associated with
      the lecture platform in America and England that I could not feel
      justified in abandoning so great a field of usefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experiences of all our successful lecturers are probably nearly alike.
      The way is not always smooth. But the hard roads, the poor hotels, the
      late trains, the cold halls, the hot church auditoriums, the overkindness
      of hospitable committees, and the broken hours of sleep are annoyances one
      soon forgets; and the hosts of intelligent faces, the messages of thanks,
      and the effects of the earnings on the lives of young college men can
      never cease to be a daily joy. God bless them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often have I been asked if I did not, in fifty years of travel in all
      sorts of conveyances, meet with accidents. It is a marvel to me that no
      such event ever brought me harm. In a continuous period of over
      twenty-seven years I delivered about two lectures in every three days, yet
      I did not miss a single engagement. Sometimes I had to hire a special
      train, but I reached the town on time, with only a rare exception, and
      then I was but a few minutes late. Accidents have preceded and followed me
      on trains and boats, and were sometimes in sight, but I was preserved
      without injury through all the years. In the Johnstown flood region I saw
      a bridge go out behind our train. I was once on a derelict steamer on the
      Atlantic for twenty-six days. At another time a man was killed in the
      berth of a sleeper I had left half an hour before. Often have I felt the
      train leave the track, but no one was killed. Robbers have several times
      threatened my life, but all came out without loss to me. God and man have
      ever been patient with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this period of lecturing has been, after all, a side issue. The
      Temple, and its church, in Philadelphia, which, when its membership was
      less than three thousand members, for so many years contributed through
      its membership over sixty thousand dollars a year for the uplift of
      humanity, has made life a continual surprise; while the Samaritan
      Hospital&rsquo;s amazing growth, and the Garretson Hospital&rsquo;s dispensaries, have
      been so continually ministering to the sick and poor, and have done such
      skilful work for the tens of thousands who ask for their help each year,
      that I have been made happy while away lecturing by the feeling that each
      hour and minute they were faithfully doing good. Temple University, which
      was founded only twenty-seven years ago, has already sent out into a
      higher income and nobler life nearly a hundred thousand young men and
      women who could not probably have obtained an education in any other
      institution. The faithful, self-sacrificing faculty, now numbering two
      hundred and fifty-three professors, have done the real work. For that I
      can claim but little credit; and I mention the University here only to
      show that my &ldquo;fifty years on the lecture platform&rdquo; has necessarily been a
      side line of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      My best-known lecture, &ldquo;Acres of Diamonds,&rdquo; was a mere accidental address,
      at first given before a reunion of my old comrades of the Forty-sixth
      Massachusetts Regiment, which served in the Civil War and in which I was
      captain. I had no thought of giving the address again, and even after it
      began to be called for by lecture committees I did not dream that I should
      live to deliver it, as I now have done, almost five thousand times. &ldquo;What
      is the secret of its popularity?&rdquo; I could never explain to myself or
      others. I simply know that I always attempt to enthuse myself on each
      occasion with the idea that it is a special opportunity to do good, and I
      interest myself in each community and apply the general principles with
      local illustrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand which now holds this pen must in the natural course of events
      soon cease to gesture on the platform, and it is a sincere, prayerful hope
      that this book will go on into the years doing increasing good for the aid
      of my brothers and sisters in the human family.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
